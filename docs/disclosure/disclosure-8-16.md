Over recent years, disclosure and transparency gained more interest in raising investors’ awareness, as their decisions depend mainly on information provided by companies.

## 1-1 Definition and concept of disclosure and transparency

Learning Objective:

Be familiar with the concept of disclosure and transparency.

Disclosure:

Disclosure is defined as revealing of (financial and non- financial) information relevant to all interested and concerned parties in a company (inside or outside the company). Such disclosure may take place periodically or immediately at the time of information, so that information is made available to everyone at the same time to achieve the goal of the capital market, which is to protect dealers from any unfair or improper practice, and to work towards achieving justice, efficiency and transparency in all securities transactions.

Transparency:

Transparency means the extent of the commitment to share information with others promptly and to provide a clear and accurate picture of everything that is happening in a way that ensures the achievement of trust, integrity, and objectivity in the company’s management procedures, as well as ensuring proper, appropriate and timely disclosures. Transparency of the information provided ensures the delivery of information of its various types (accounting, financial and non-financial disclosure) and that this information is correct, precise, and complete to all stakeholders.

Transparency is defined as the full disclosure of true administrative and financial status of any entity. Transparency requires that published material data, reports or events reflect entity factual status clearly and explicitly.

Thus, we can say that transparency is the whole process of the company’s work procedures that are reflected in the disclosure reports through which the listed companies announce information to the public and the financial community related to the trading of securities related to buy and sell orders, to provide the required interaction between the supply and

9

demand processes to determine the price of the security, announcing the information related to the transactions concluded in terms of the quantities and prices of the securities subject of these transactions and providing an opportunity for those who want to examine them.

Conditions that must be met in transparent information:

There are several conditions to be met in any transparent information or procedure, including:

1- Transparency shall take place at the appropriate time (immediately after the event and before the opening of the trading session that follows the event), as the delay in publishing the disclosure does not help the investor make the right investment decision.

2- Transparency shall be made available to all parties at the same time.

3- Transparency shall be clear and unambiguous and includes the minimum information that is required to be announced.

“Transparency” principle is closely related to registration, documentation and reporting, so as to be available to all dealers and to inform them of any technical information or financial data relating to company’s activities and decision-making processes.
