## 2-1 Importance of disclosure and transparency in capital market

Learning Objective:

Be familiar with the importance of disclosure and transparency in capital market.

In 2018, Saudi Exchange (Tadawul) became a partner that supports the United Nations Sustainable Capital Markets Initiative. This initiative aims to enhance awareness of environmental, social and corporate governance principles and initiatives and encourage sustainable investment in cooperation with investors and exporters.

Disclosure in financial reports of the necessary information is an important matter that supports the United Nations' initiative for sustainable capital markets and ensures the optimal performance of efficient capital markets. The information must be disclosed if its omission distorts the significance of what it provides to the beneficiaries and users of the financial reports.

The disclosure means:

- Presentation of important information for the beneficiary groups such as investors, creditors and others
- The presentation in a way that allows prediction of the entity’s ability to achieve profits in the future.
- Measuring its ability to pay its obligations

It is also worth noting the relative benefit of disclosure for creditor investors, and it also has a relative benefit for other parties benefiting from financial reports, such as employees, customers, and the general public.

## 2-2 Clear and Accurate Information

Learning Objective:

Be familiar with clarity and correctness of information from the issuer.

Where, in the opinion of the issuer, disclosure of any matter required by these rules would be unduly detrimental to the issuer, and omission is not likely to mislead investors with regard to facts and circumstances, knowledge of which is essential for the assessment of the related securities, the issuer may apply for a waiver from the relevant requirement or otherwise request to delay the disclosure. The issuer must in that case provide to the authority on a strictly confidential basis a statement of the requested waiver or delay together with the reasons why the issuer believes that the information should not be disclosed at that time.

The authority may approve or reject the application for a waiver or delay. If the authority approves the application for a waiver or delay, the authority may at any time require the issuer to disclose any information in relation to the waiver or delay. (Article (61) Paragraph (b) of rules on the Offering of Securities and Continuing Obligations).

With the exception from paragraph (a) of this article, if the issuer is a special purposes entity, the special purposes entity shall disclose to the authority and the public without delay any material developments that fall within the scope of its activity and the knowledge of which is not available to the general public, and which may affect the assets or liabilities of the special purposes entity and can reasonably lead to a change in the price of the listed securities or have a significant impact on the ability of the special purpose entity to meet its debt instrument related obligations.(Article (61) Paragraph (b) of rules on the Offering of Securities and Continuing Obligations).

## 2-3 Importance of disclosure to investor and impact of disclosure on securities prices

Learning Objective:

Be familiar with the impact of disclosure on share prices and trading volume

The disclosure provides essential benefits for measuring the impact of governance “a set of rules, laws, and foundations that control the work of companies and achieve effective control over their board of directors, and regulate the relationship between them and stakeholders, to achieve transparency, justice and combating embezzlement and corruption.” The application of sustainability principles to future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital contributes to evaluating companies by identifying how these companies face the most critical challenges and risks, which is beneficial to all and contributes to the establishment of a more prosperous economic system and more stable and resilient markets.

The importance of the impact of disclosure on stock prices comes from the importance of the principle of disclosure due to the emergence of joint stock companies and the emergence of legal acts that obliges joint stock companies to publish financial statements for them at a specific time and also to provide scientific evidence for the link between the issuance of annual financial reports and the impact of this on stock returns and the volume of trading.

By measuring the impact of disclosure on trading volume, the studies concluded that three hypotheses were tested:

The first was that there was a direct relationship between disclosure and stock prices in the capital market.

The second was that the timing of disclosing accounting information enables rational investment decisions to be taken.

The third: represented that there is a significant relationship between the volume of trading and the degree of disclosure of accounting information.

20

The financial reports of the companies listed in the market were analyzed. After the analysis, the study reached several results, the most important of which are:

1. For the investor to make rational investment decisions, the most important variables affecting the market prices of the shares mentioned in the published financial reports of the listed companies must be identified.
2. The inappropriate timing of the accounting information mentioned in the published financial reports is one of the essential criticisms directed at these reports, which limits the possibility of relying on them as a primary source of information that the investor must rely on when making his investment decisions.
3. Researchers agree that stock prices in the capital market reflect the available information about these stocks, but they differ in the quality of the information and the extent of price response.

## 2-4 Disclosure and the ability of the capital market to attract investments
