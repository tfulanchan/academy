Introduction:

This chapter outlines the factors affecting the decision to accept financing requests and identifies customer condition assessment according to financing criteria. The chapter also clarifies the main application procedures for obtaining a bank credit, criteria thereof  as well as customer responsibilities in the financing agreement in the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia.  This chapter also introduces Responsible Lending Principles for Individual Customers.

## 2.1 Factors Affecting the Acceptance of  Applications for Financing 

Individual Customers:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with factors affecting acceptance of  applications for financing individual customers.

### 2.1.1 Factors Affecting the Acceptance of  Applications for Financing Individual Customers:

There are several factors influencing financing requests, some of  which are related to the customer and others are related to banks and finance companies.

1. Factors Related to Individual Customers:

Credit-granting criteria comprise several models that banks consider in customer finance applications. Such models include a set of  principles and guidelines that help the bank to make credit decisions. We will introduce the Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) and Customer Credit Report (CCR), as main indicators used by banks to recognize the customer’s creditworthiness. In this part, we will also introduce a credit criteria model (P5), which consists of  People, Payment, Purpose, Protection and Prospective. Before introducing such model, we will discuss the CRR in further detail:

+ Customer Credit Report (CCR): 

CCR is a comprehensive and thorough report containing all details of  the customer’s credit transactions with creditors. The report includes the financial products acquired such as loans and credit cards, in addition to some private information such as the maturity date, installment amount and payment status. The first report can be obtained free of  charge from the Saudi Credit Bureau (SIMAH). A detailed explanation of  CCR will be provided later in this Chapter.

+ Debt Burden Ratio (DBR):

DBR reflects the customer tolerance against payment of  the monthly installments based on his salary or monthly income. We will discuss the quantitative principles of  responsible financing later (See 2.2.4 Quantitative Principles for Responsible

Determination of  DBR aims to:
- Regulate the lending process and keep the financial burden of  monthly payments under control.
- Foster the protection against delinquency by sticking to such ratio.
- Avoid wasting time and effort for a finance request that could eventually be rejected.
- DBR is a main factor that helps lenders to determine the extent of  risks associated

46

with the credit file, and thus to decide whether to refuse, accept or even take measures to guarantee their rights.

Below is an example on how to calculate the DBR:

Example:

If the customer’s monthly salary is SAR 10,000, and the value of  all monthly payments is SAR 3,000. Then the DBR shall be 30% (DBR=3.000/10.000 x “100”=”30%” ). (DBR=×100=30%)

+ Credit Model (P5):

Model-5 includes the key customer-related criteria that start with ‘P’ letter, namely  People, 
Payment, Purpose, Protection, and Prospective.

A. People:

Evaluating the customer’s ethics and creditworthiness.

B. Payment:

This criterion assesses the customer solvency based on prior entries.

C. Purpose:

This involves the areas or activities in which the borrowed funds are invested and how far they are consistent with the financial institution (FI) policy and customer’s capabilities, expertise and credit profiles as well as the extent to which the size and amount of  finance are appropriate for the customer’s purposes.

D. Protection:

This criterion addresses the availability of  guarantees provided by the borrower to FI in terms of  its market value, liquidity and risks.

E. Prospective:

This relates to future predictions and all environmental and future conditions surrounding the customer.

1. Factors Related to Banks and Financing Companies:

There are many factors related to banks and creditors that affect finance applications, such as:

A. Liquidity of  the FI:

Liquidity means the ability of  the FI to meet its obligations. This ability is essentially linked to the stability of deposits, as the fluctuating deposits will limit bank’s ability to adopt a comprehensive lending policy. Consequently, the credit management has to achieve two opposing objectives:  meeting depositors’ requests on the one hand, and meeting credit applications on the other hand.

B. Objective of the FI:

The objective of  a bank or FI means the type of  to-be-followed strategy to take credit decisions and to operate within its framework. For example, shall the bank tend more to mortgage finance, customer finance, or companies and investment projects finance

C. Capacity of  Banks and FIs:

It means the capacity of  banks or FIs especially in terms of  qualified and trained capabilities to perform credit functions as well as modern technology they utilize.

D. Compliance with Controls and Legislation:

The bank must comply with laws and regulations issued by SAMA, which determines the possibility of  expanding or lowering loans, as well as loan limit and areas of  activity allowed to be financed, so as to avoid any conflict between the bank’s credit policy and legislation regarding banking activities.

E. High Risk of Lending:

Lending risks can be defined as the inability to expect the exact profits desired and expected from fund utilization. Lending risks are associated with the bank’s activity.

Below are some of  the main factors affecting the bank’s lending policy: 

1. Risk of  Default:  Debtor-related risks when the customer cannot repay the loan and interest thereof, for reasons related either to its business or to deterioration of  economic conditions and low income.
2. Interest Rate Risk:  Risks associated with the potential change in interest rates, which affects the bank’s financing cost.
3. Inflation Risk:  Risks associated with purchasing power of  loans and interests.
4. Liquidity Risk:  Risks caused as a result of  the high demand for loans, which raises risks of liquidity shortage against the lending bank.
5. Exchange Rate Risk:  Risks associated with the change in exchange rates.

48

## 2.2 Responsible Lending Principles for Individual Customers:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with the principles of  responsible lending for individual customers

SAMA issued Responsible Lending Principles for Individual Customers. The principles aim to encourage responsible lending that meets the actual needs of  customers, especially those related to owning housing and assets rather than customer purposes. The principles also aim to enhance financial inclusion by providing adequate financing for all segments of  society, taking into account reasonable deductible ratios that the customer can afford. In addition, the principles focus on ensuring fairness and competitiveness among creditors to make sure that their procedures and mechanisms are effective and efficient.

The principles apply to all creditors and finance activities directed at customers. These activities encompass all credit products and programs designed for individuals, including, but not limited to, personal finance, vehicle finance, credit cards and real estate finance. The creditor must set appropriate internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with these principles, other relevant laws, regulations, and instructions. It must also pay special attention to documenting information and maintaining documents provided by customers, thereby gaining an acceptable degree of  reliability.

If the creditor assigns certain related work to another party or other parties, it must ensure that those parties act in compliance with these principles and that they do not contravene the provisions hereof, other relevant laws, regulations and instructions. The creditor must take necessary measures to ensure that these principles are fully understood and adhered to by its staff  and are shared with its customers. It must not only focus on the number of financing agreements or the value of  finance, but it must also take into account such principles when preparing its incentive programs for its staff. It must ensure that no programs are developed in a way that may lead to irresponsible finance. The creditor must keep sufficient records that show its commitment to the principles herein, other related laws, regulations, and instructions.

### 2.2.1 Definitions:

Some definitions in responsible financing shall be identified before discussing qualitative and quantitative principles of  financing. 

Creditor: Banks and finance companies supervised by SAMA and licensed to practice one or more activities of finance.

Principles: Responsible Lending Principles for Individual Customers. 

Customer: An individual who obtains or applies for a finance loan or at whom such finance is directed. 

Finance Amount: The limit or the total amount made available to the customer under a finance contract. 

Term Cost: The term cost due by the customer under a finance contract, which may be expressed as a fixed or changed annual percentage of  the finance amount provided for the customer.

49

Variable Term Cost: The term cost specified according to an index or a reference rate, which must be explicitly stated in the finance contract; such a cost will change in accordance with the change in such an index. 

Total Amount Payable by the Customer: Finance amount plus all due costs that the customer must pay as per provisions of  finance contract, including term cost, fees, commissions, administrative costs, insurance and any expenses deemed necessary to obtain finance and excluding any expenses that the customer can avoid, such as costs and fees customer must pay upon his/her violation of  any obligations mentioned in the finance contract. 

Monthly Credit Obligations: Total amount payable by the customer, which is calculated on a monthly basis, as per the credit report issued by licensed credit bureaus and the customer’s disclosure.

Gross Salary: The basic monthly salary (after deducting pension or GOSI contributions) plus all fixed allowances paid to the customer by the employer on a monthly basis.

Total monthly income: The monthly average income of  the customer from any periodical income whether received on a monthly, annual or other periodic basis, including gross salary or any other income (allowances and compensation that are paid periodically, rental income, revenues of  other investments, etc.) which can be reasonably verified and calculated, in accordance with the provisions of  these principles, paragraph (17).

Total Monthly Income: The remaining amount of  the customer’s total monthly income for spending, investment or savings after deducting current or expected basic expenses and monthly credit obligations, calculated on a monthly basis.

Deductible Ratio: The ratio of  customer’s monthly credit obligations to total monthly income, calculated as per terms and conditions stated in Chapter IV on Quantitative Principles of  Responsible Lending.

Deduction: The act of  deducting an amount from the customer’s gross salary or monthly pension. 

### 2.2.2 Qualitative Principles of  Responsible Lending:

1. The creditor must adopt a clear, transparent and documented scientific method, criteria and procedures to evaluate the creditworthiness of  the customer and his/her ability to repay. Upon the customer’s consent, the creditor must examine the credit record of  the customer to verify his/ her solvency, ability to meet the monthly credit obligations, and his/her credit behavior. The information obtained must be documented in the finance file.
2. The creditor must ask the customer to disclose, in writing, any other credit obligations he/she has, such as loans from his/her employer, friends or relatives or any other obligations.
3. The creditor must assess the ability of  its customers to meet monthly credit obligations, especially in cases where customer’s deductible ratios are close to the maximum deduction limits set out herein. The assessment of  the ability to meet monthly credit obligations is primarily based on the assessment of  the customer’s monthly disposable income that can be used to meet his/her monthly credit obligations
4. Based on paragraph (3) and based on a credit study and assessment of the customer’s monthly disposable income, the creditor must use financial models and tools to measure the customer’s ability to meet monthly credit obligations and to what extent such finance suits his/her

50

needs and circumstances. The creditor must ensure both the efficiency and effectiveness of  such financial models and tools, used to measure the customer’s ability to repay finance.

It should benefit from its information and data, as well as legally available general statistics sources. 

### 2.2.3 Quantitative Principles of  Responsible Lending: 

A. Terms for calculating the customer’s monthly credit obligations must be observed as follows:
1. The monthly credit obligation of  a credit card must be equal to the minimum repayment of the credit ceiling for each credit card issued to the customer.
2. Monthly credit obligations include all credit obligations to creditors and specialized government lending institutions and any other credit obligations.
3. Before granting finance with variable term cost and upon calculating the monthly credit obligations of  such finance, the creditor must take into account including additional margin in the term cost.
4. Upon granting finance, the creditor must be responsible when the deductible ratio exceeds the permitted limit hereunder if  it is due to a change in the term cost.
5. Monthly credit obligations of  finance where all installments are not equal must be calculated based on monthly installments that are fixed at the monthly average level for all installments regardless of  whether such finance is payable by equal repayments or requires a final payment.

B. Terms for calculating the total monthly income of  the customer must be observed as follows:

+ Gross salary, as documented by any means by the employer, must be included in such calculation.
+ As for other income, half  of  the monthly average of  the total amount earned by the customer from any periodical income, whether monthly, annual or other, must be included in such calculation. The other income must include periodically-paid allowances and compensation, rental income, revenues of  investments, dividends, etc., which can be reasonably verified via, at least, a two-year bank statement or official documents proving their continuity.

+ Government subsidies, such as those given through the Citizen Account Program or social security, must not be counted as part of  the total monthly income of  the customer.

Deductible ratios for customers whose total monthly income is SAR 15,000 and less must be subject to the following restrictions:

+ The monthly credit obligations of  finance, which are linked only to the monthly deduction of the gross salary, must not exceed 33.33% of  the gross salary for employees and 25% for retired customers. 
+ Monthly credit obligations, excluding monthly credit obligations for real estate finance must not exceed 45% of  the total monthly income of  the customer.
+ Monthly credit obligations of  finance must not exceed 55% of  the total monthly income of  the customer However, for the customers who are benefiting from the Ministry of  Housing or the Real Estate Development Fund for mortgage products, the monthly obligations of  finance must not exceed 65% of  the total monthly income51Deductible ratios for customers whose total monthly income is more than SAR 15,000 and less than SAR 25,000 must be subject to the following restrictions:
+ The monthly credit obligations of finance, which are linked only to the monthly deduction of  the gross salary, must not exceed 33.33% of the gross salary for employees and 25% for retired customers.
+ Monthly credit obligations, excluding monthly credit obligations for real estate finance must not exceed 45% of  the total monthly income of the customer.
+ Monthly credit obligations of finance must not exceed 65% of the total monthly income of the customer. 

Deductible ratios for customers whose total monthly income is SAR 25,000 and more must be subject to the following restrictions:
+ The monthly credit obligations of  finance, which are linked only to the monthly deduction of  the gross salary, must not exceed 33.33% of  the gross salary for employees and 25% for retired customers.

1.  Credit obligations of  finance are subject to the credit policies of  the creditor. The creditor must assess the ability of  its customers to meet monthly credit obligations stated herein.
2.  Finance term must not exceed (5) years or (60) months from granting such finance, except for real estate finance and credit cards. 

SAMA may review and amend periodically the ratios indicated in these Principles, taking into account the soundness and stability of  the financial system and the forecasts for economic growth.

## 2.3 Key Procedures and Documents for Obtaining Finance Product:

Almost all financing companies require the same documents and procedures to provide any finance products to customers. This section explains general steps for key documents and procedures followed in extending finance products.

As mentioned earlier, finance products for individuals are credit cards, personal finance, real estate finance, and motor vehicle finance.

Procedures for Obtaining a Credit Card:

First Step: Application Submission
+ Fill out the card application (may be e-application).
+ A valid national ID/residency permit.
+ Customer credit report.
+ No account with the finance company required.
+ salary statement letter from the employer.

Second Step: Document Review & Card Issuance
+ Submitting all documents above.
+ Reviewing information and checking the customer’s credit record. 
+ Then, the finance company contacts the client (via a reliable means of  communication) to inform the client on request acceptance or rejection, with an explanation of  grounds for rejection.
+ If  the application accepted, the customer will be informed of  the credit limit of  the card.
+ If  the customer accepts such credit limit, the card is issued and sent to the customer.
+ The card is activated by the customer upon receiving the card.  

Note:

In light of  the current information revolution, some finance companies provide virtual card service because all customer’s information is available to them. Thus, procedures become easier, and the customer only has to agree on card issuance. The customer’s approval to issue a card and documentation thereof  is a prerequisite for the finance company, in accordance with the provisions of  Regulations for Issuance and Operations of  Credit and Charge Cards issued by SAMA.

Procedures for Obtaining a Personal Finance:

After exploring steps and requirements for obtaining credit cards, the requirements for personal finance can be clarified as follows:

First Step: Application Submission:
+ Filling out an application for obtaining personal finance (may be e-application ). In this step, the purpose of  personal finance is determined, including: (Purchasing a car/furniture/travel/medicine...etc.).
+ A valid national ID/residency permit.
+ Customer credit report.
+ Opening an account with the finance company is mandatory. In finance companies not li -censed to open accounts for clients, such companies shall open an account with a relevant bank.

53

+ Salary statement/transfer letter from the employer.

Note: 

Salary transfer is requested for employers that do not have salary transfer agreements with the finance company. This serves as a commitment from the employer to continue transferring the client’s salary to the finance company until full indebtedness is paid, and such salary will not be transferred to another entity until the client is given a clearance letter from the finance company stating that such client has paid all due amounts and have no further other obligations.

Second Step: Documentation Review and Conclusion of  Personal Finance Contract:
+ Submitting all documents above.
+ Reviewing information and checking the customer’s credit record.
+ Then, the finance company contacts the client (via a reliable means of  communication) to inform the client on request acceptance or rejection, with an explanation of  grounds for rejection.
+ If the application accepted, the customer will be informed of  the credit limit granted thereto.

Third Step: Issuance of  Contracts & Documents:
+ After contracts are issued, the customer visits the nearest branch to sign contracts and documents.
+ Contracts and documents signed by the customer are reviewed by the finance company to ensure their correctness and completeness.
+ The finance amount is deposited into the customer’s account.

Procedures for Obtaining a Real Estate Finance:

After exploring steps and requirements for obtaining personal finance, the requirements for real estate finance can be clarified as follows:
+ Filling out an application for real estate finance (may be e-application).. Purpose of  such real estate finance shall be specified, for example: (Purchasing a fully-furnished house (villa or apartment), an unfinished house or land/Off-plan sale ...etc.)
+ A valid national ID/residency permit (for Premium Residency holders).
+ A copy of  the property title deed.
+ A copy of  the property owner’s ID and contact numbers.
+ Property location coordinates.
+ Customer credit report.
+ Opening an account with the finance company is mandatory. In finance companies not licensed to open accounts for clients, such companies shall open an account with a relevant bank.
+ Salary statement/transfer letter from the employer.

After exploring these requirements, we can now clarify real estate finance procedures, which undergoes several steps as follows:

First Step: Initial Offer to Customer:

After examining the customer’s credit and financial position to ensure his debt sustainability, the customer obtains the credit limit allowed. Then, the finance company contacts the client (via a reliable means of  communication) to inform the client on request acceptance or rejection, with an explanation of  grounds for rejection.

Second Step: Property Evaluation: 

The property is evaluated by certified and authorized real estate appraisers. The evaluation must be based on property’s logistic and technical value. This involves evaluation of  structure, construction materials, and guarantees provided by the owner.

Third Step: Final Offer:  

After property evaluation, the client receives a final offer, agreeing upon the following:
+ Amount of  advance payment.
+ Profit margin ratio.
+ Amount of  finance needed to purchase the property.
+ Total finance amount (Finance amount + term cost).
+ Monthly payment amount.
+ Number of  installments.

Fourth Step: Contract Review:

According to SAMA instructions to financing companies issued in June 2020, the finance company shall submit to the customer a finance offer whose validity period shall not be less than fifteen (15) business days from the date of  receipt by the client. The offer can be submitted to the client on paper or electronically as per client’s preference, provided that such offer includes all data and documents in the same form that the client will sign in case of  concluding a real estate finance contract. The submitted offer must include the following documents:
+ The real estate finance contract and attachments thereto.
+ Disclosure form of  the real estate finance offer.
+ Acknowledgment form for accepting the credit risk of  real estate finance with variable  term cost, in accordance with the form contained in the annex below, for real estate products with variable cost.

Further, the following must be observed: 
+ The financier must document the customer’s receipt of  such documents, . whether they were submitted to him in paper or electronically The financier shall enable the customer, if  he prefers the printed offer, to retrieve such documents from the financier’s office. The customer may present those documents to whomever he wants to request their opinion and advice. The financier may not conclude any real estate finance contract unless after submitting to and enabling the customer to retrieve such documents from the financier’s premises.
+ The financier shall, in a sufficient period before the expiry of  the offer, assign a qualified credit advisor who has adequate knowledge of  real estate finance products for individuals to provide the customer, in person or by phone, with a clear explanation of the nature of the proposed real estate finance and associated risks, terms and conditions

55

of contract, re-pricing mechanism (if  any). Such  credit advisor shall also answer all the customer’s inquiries in such regard in full transparency and clarity. The credit advisor may not be the same employee who communicated with the customer before submitting the offer or who submitted the offer to the customer.

+ Documenting communication with the credit advisor is a prerequisite for completing the contract. Communication shall be documented using audio recording or by signing a form proving the customer’s meeting with the advisor. The financier may not conclude any real estate finance contract unless the credit advisor provides the required explanation to the customer, answers and documents all his inquiries.
+ There shall be a waiting period of  no less than five (5) business days from the date of the customer’s receipt of  such offer, to enable the customer to review the offer, consult with the credit advisor or whoever he wants. The financier shall ask the customer not to initiate any action regarding the property during such 5-day period, such as making a down payment or deposit. The financier may not conclude any real estate financing contract before the waiting period has expired.

Fifth Step: Contract Signing

After fulfilling all the previous requirements, and customer’s acceptance to contract with the finance company for the selected product, based on mutual agreement between both parties, the contract shall be signed as follows:
+ The finance company purchases the real estate from the owner with the right to cancel, which means that the buyer (finance company) may cancel such purchase when the installment sale is not completed by the customer.
+ Signing sales contracts, carried out by way of  Murabaha or Ijara with the customer.

Note:

In order for the financing process to comply with rules and regulations of  Islamic Sharia, the property purchase contract must be signed by the owner before the sale of  such property to the customer. This must also be documented by writing the time and date on both contracts, so that the time of  purchase is earlier than the time of  sale.

Sixth Stage: Completion of  Contract and Transfer of  Ownership, Mortgage of Property

The purchase and sale processes shall be documented through notary offices, and property deed shall indicate that such property is mortgaged to the finance company and such mortgage will be released after full indebtedness is paid.

Note: Promissory Note is one of  the key documents that must be approved and signed by the customer, especially in personal finance and real estate finance products. The promissory note in Saudi laws is defined as a document that must be executed by courts or competent authorities, indicating the order of  a certain person to pay a specified amount to another person. 

56

## 2.4 Credit Bureau: 

First, we shall clarify the concept of  customer’s credit history, together with a number of indicators on integrity of  such credit history, as detailed below:

What is customer’s credit history?

Customer’s credit history is defined as a measure of  the customer’s ability to repay debts and establish his responsibility towards such repayment. It is usually recorded on the customer’s credit report, which details the following:
+  Number and types of  the customer’s credit accounts, term of  each account, and amounts due.
+ Amount of  available credit used, whether invoices are paid on time, and last credit amount the customer received. 
+ A customer’s credit report also contains information regarding whether s/he has had any bankruptcies, liens, collections or judgments. 

It is worth noting that the customer has the right to access his credit history (via a credit report). The customer usually gets many advantages when he has a good credit history, for example low profit margin quotes on mortgage loans, car insurance, etc.

Importance of Customer’s Credit History

Finance companies usually use information in a customer’s credit history to decide on credit extension. Information in customer’s credit history is also used to evaluate the customer’s repayment commitment. When creditors review a customer’s credit history, they evaluate several different aspects, including:
+ Customer’s recent credit activity.
+ How long credit accounts have been open and active.
+ Patterns and regularity of  repayment over longer periods.

Good Credit History:   

Basically, having a good credit history indicates that the customer pay monthly installments on time and not incurring large amounts of  debt. This facilitates obtaining credit cards, gives the customer better options for finance, as well as lower profit margin rates. The perfect way to maintain a good credit report is to:
+ Pay all monthly installments in full without delay against maturity dates.
+ The customer should not have many credit cards, and shall keep his cards with low balance and for a long period of  time.
+ The customer should regularly check his credit reports and be firm about correcting any errors relating to his account.

Poor Credit History:  

Conversely, customers who have a poor credit history do not repay their installments on time and have a large amount of outstanding debt. Factors that contribute to a bad credit history include:
+ Late or missed payments.   
+ Excessive use of credit cards.   
 
57

+ Applying for a lot of credit in a short period of time. 
+ Suffering financial issues such as bankruptcy. 

A poor credit history can lead to difficulty in obtaining financing and credit cards, as well as low credit limits with high profit margin rates.

Credit Companies in Saudi Arabia:

Based on Royal Decree No. M/37 dated 05/07/1429 AH, Cabinet Resolution No. 188 dated 04/07/1429 AH was issued approving the Credit Information Law.  Several companies have been established, including Saudi Credit Bureau (SIMAH).

SIMAH is the first and sole licensed national credit bureau offering consumer and commercial credit information services. SIMAH was founded in 2002 and started operation in 2004 under the supervision of  the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA). SIMAH credit reports help develop the national economy in general, and help banks to understand and know how to deal with credit history of  individuals. SIMAH basic roles include working side by side and cooperates with SAMA to develop procedures followed across banking sector, related to credit facilities provided to individuals and companies. 

SIMAH was established (at that time) by ten local commercial banks operating in KSA based on current banking laws and regulations issued by SAMA.

SIMAH reports for individuals are an effective tool for determining levels of  credit risk, as they rely on unique and improved evaluation models suitable for the Saudi market.

Launched in 2004, SIMATI is the first core system in Saudi Arabia which provides detailed credit reports of  individuals indicating their financial stability,  including positive and negative credit information enabling members to make informed credit decisions.  It should also be noted that SIMATI is the first SIMAH system concerned with preserving credit information on individuals. it was registered with the Ministry of  Commerce as one of  SIMAH’s trademarks in December 2018. Through SIMATI’s credit report, including credit information for each individual, SIMAH member creditors can reliably and accurately measure credit behavior of  individuals and predict their ability to meet obligations before starting a credit relationship, which mitigates potential credit risks, as credit information is the fastest tool for measuring individuals ‘ credit behavior.

SIMAH Advantages:

1. Mitigating Financial Risks: High and low risk loans can be identified by the members based on SIMATI reports by identifying the history of  individual’s payments, credit card balances, defaults, latest applications for credit etc. SIMATI reports make use of  detailed, accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date credit information on consumers for members to take best credit decisions & mitigate risks.
2. Cross Selling & Up Selling:  SIMATI reports provide profound insights into the customer’s credit history and risk associated with extending credit. Apart from this, SIMATI reports accurately create prospective opportunities based on the numerous data sources and SIMAH score to evaluate possibilities to upsell and cross sell products and services ensuring both portfolio diversification optimization profitability. 
3. Reducing Information Asymmetries: Asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers is one of  the most common challenges in the credit market worldwide; leading to adversities in lending credit and causing a higher risk of  default or making lenders hesitant to offer customized credit products and services. With multiple lenders having different patterns of  information for same consumers, it becomes difficult to measure the financial status and creditworthiness of  historical and/or potential borrowers. SIMATI reports provide standardized, deep, accurate and up to date credit information about individuals to all members so as to be able to take sound strategic decisions.
4. Quick Credit Sanctioning: SIMAH Scoring gives the first impression or bird’s eye view to the member about the individual’s creditworthiness. The first step in any credit approval process is checking the credit score of  the applicant, a satisfactory score would be a “go ahead”  signal and a negative score would mean reconsideration of  the credit application. Scoring enables the credit granting process to become faster and streamlined with the evaluation and eventual processing taking a few minutes rather than taking weeks or even months in certain instances.
5. Higher Profitability:  Scoring helps members make profitable yet consumer centric decisions by identifying the most profitable customers and clients, developing retention and growth strategies and improve credit portfolio management. Scoring can help create tearing models of  customers based on their credit scores and help create effective pricing and promotional programs proactively targeting customers for higher profitability. 
6. Debt Management: As lending becomes future oriented and forward looking, SIMAH Scoring helps members to be at the forefront of  innovation by optimizing collection efforts, minimize defaults, maximize recoveries and reduce overall overhead costs.

SIMAH Scoring reveals other advantages such as:
+ Risk mitigation
+ More predictive power
+ Competitive advantage
+ Better policy execution
+ Higher consumer satisfaction
+ Upselling & cross-sellingChapter
