Introduction:

Accurate determination of credit risk and development of indicators and data to help measure them are instrumental to manage and control risks, thus minimizing risks. This Chapter focuses on credit risks that affect customers in addition to the financial objec -tives that are in line with customers financial position and applicable procedures. The Chapter further explains collection controls and procedures, as well as procedures for dealing with defaulting customers.

## 4.1 Customer Credit Risk and Impact Thereon:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with customer credit risk and the impact thereon.

### 4.1.1 Customer Credit Risk: 

Credit decision-making in any bank or FI is influenced by a number of interrelated and complementary factors, i.e. customer-related factors and FI-related factors, as previously mentioned in the first part of Chapter II. However, we should mention some of SAMA’s functions provided to protect customer rights, as follows: 

Customer Protection:

One of SAMA’s functions is to supervise licensed FIs authorized to operate in KSA including banks, insurance companies, money exchanger companies and credit information companies.

SAMA has been a strong advocate of the protection of customer interests and played an important role so as to ensure that customers are dealt with professionally and fairly since the issuance of the Banking Control Law in 1966. SAMA’s role has gradually extended in line with the expansion of the financial sector. In 2005, SAMA was designated as the regulator for the insurance sector under the Cooperative Insurance Law, in 2012, it also became responsible for supervising and overseeing finance companies thus further extending SAMA’s role in strengthening customer protection. Thus, SAMA established “Customer Protection Department”, which is mainly entrusted to ensure that customers dealing with institutions get a fair treatment transparently and honestly, and obtain financial services and products easily and smoothly at suitable costs and high quality, through the following:
+ Following-up developments and trends in the financial sector and determine priorities and behaviors of financial services beneficiaries.
+ Raising FI customers’ awareness about key financial matters by providing training programs and information.
+ Developing customer protection instructions (e.g. pricing, customer communication, and quality of service provided)
+ Ensuring that all financial sectors comply with policies within the scope of customer protection functions.
+ Receiving and addressing customer complaints across all different financial sectors.

## 4.2 Financial Objectives Consistent with the Customer’s Financial Position:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with the financial objectives that are consistent with the customer’s financial position.

### 4.2.1 Financial Objectives Consistent with the Customer’s Financial Position: 

Customers are engaged to identify realistic financial objectives that are consistent with their financial position, circumstances, education, and scientific and practical experience. In communicating with customers, the credit officer must figure out the level of their financial awareness, knowledge of banking services and products, as well as how to benefit from such inputs according to such financial circumstances. Such objectives include:

A. Raising Customer Financial Awareness:

The cultural and social environment of customers seeking financial services constitute main driver in customers’ decisions. The credit officer shall act as a guide to familiarize customers with the development and diversity of banking services, and how such developments can achieve material benefits for them so as to cut costs against obtaining such services. Moreover, the banking awareness is defined as the habit of individuals and economic sectors to deposit their funds in banks, their reliance on bank checks in their economic transactions, and their knowledge of banking services and products that are consistent with their needs. The demand for bank deposits is positively correlated to the spread of banking awareness, and the contrary leads to hoarding.

The bank or FI officer plays a significant role in raising the financial awareness of their customers, not only by providing different financial services and products, but also through clarifying advantages of such products or services, customer’s capability and circumstances, as well as the most appropriate way to use them in an optimal way that is consistent with customers’ needs. The bank officer shall also:

+ Pay attention to the trends and needs of various customers dealing with FI.
+ Identify and meet the needs of customers at the right place and time with an affordable price.
+ Find the most cost-effective way to meet such desires so as to gain profit.

B. Customer Rights:

Bank customers’ rights were identified under the “G20 High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection” by a working group of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2011, as explained in the previous chapters. 

C. Customer Financial Objectives:

Customer’s financial objectives differ and vary according to his purposes for obtaining the financial assistance from the bank. Such objectives may be categorized as follows:

78

1. Investment Credit:

The credit sought by customer to finance his long-term operations, which aim to obtain either:
+ Production means and equipment; 
+ Real estate, such as land, industrial, commercial, and administrative buildings.

1. Commercial Credit :

The customer aims to finance his business for the purpose of purchasing goods for trading.

1. Consumer Credit:

The customer seeks to finance his consumption activities such as buying a car or electrical appliances for a house or financing other consumption needs.

1. Mortgage Finance:
The customer seeks finance to buy a property for living. The FI’s employee shall clarify the 
available alternatives of services and products that are consistent with the customer’s ability 
to repayment of the amount of financing and the period of repayment in order to make the right decision.

## 4.3 Other Retail Credit Risks and How They Are Managed:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with the nature of retail credit risk

Despite the importance of money laundering and terrorist financing, there are other risks that must be taken into account to preserve reputation of financial institution. The successive financial crises and economic challenges worldwide during the past decade, most notably USA Mortgage Crisis 2008, made the collection and analysis of individuals’ credit data an urgent necessity and revealed that analysis of borrowers’ history is not sufficient to manage such credit risks. However, some involving and influencing factors and data must be taken into consideration, e.g. economic cycle, tax laws, high prices, unemployment, and other factors.

The availability of data related to performance of credit portfolio and its analysis that reveals quality of portfolio or ability to realize intended rates of return is not sufficient per se. The key aspect of analysis is to figure out reasons for performance as indicated by root cause analysis. 

At the beginning of the Asian Economic Crisis 1997 (Thailand), credit portfolio of individuals in banks had grown rapidly, especially credit extended to low-income people, as many products were launched in such sector, without enough stress tests under challenging economic scenarios. Before exacerbation, several credit officers in Thai banks noticed an abnormal growth in retail portfolios performance. Opinions differed at that time on reason behind such sudden acceleration. Some attributed to the Chinese New Year, and some attributed to leniency in granting products. However, some believed that reason behind such acceleration was investments flowing to the country, amounting $142 billion at the time, due to high returns.

A. Credit Portfolio Drivers: 

Analysis of credit portfolio behavior and performance should consider core reasons behind such behavior or performance. Many factors may affect performance of retail credit portfolios, indicating their pattern of behavior, most notably: 

+ Soundness of Credit Extension Process.
+ Competition.
+ Portfolio lifespan.
+ Economic factors.

It can be detailed as follows:

First: Soundness of Credit Extension Process:

Note that the most important factor in successful performance of any credit portfolio is the starting point, i.e. credit extension process. Such process must be based on several aspects, most notably:

+ Market survey and prevailing market conditions before selecting and providing credit products.
+ Adoption of a balanced credit policy approved by financial institution’s board of directors.
+ A segregation of duties between the sale and grant process.

80

+ A segregation of duties between the sale and grant process.
+ Adopting credit scoring systems.
+ Leveraging services and reports of credit bureaus. 
+ Periodic review of credit policies for more efficient credit process (At least annually) or whenever needed.

Second: Competition:

In times of economic prosperity, FIs do not make as much effort to attract customers as in a recession. In the latter case, i.e., a recession, there is no demand for credit. If this is accompanied by a large number of lending institutions, the result will inevitably be fierce competition among FIs to attract credit-qualified customers. Here, the problem of negative selection appears, which is the phenomenon of accepting customers who are rejected by other FIs or who do not meet the criteria for granting credit according to the policies adopted by FI. In such situations, loan managers must pay attention to the following:

+ Review the report of credit information company to ensure that no outstanding receivables.
+ Ensure that there are no rejected credit requests of the customer from other FIs.
+ Limit exceptions or non-granting of credit where the conditions do not apply.
+ Ensure that there is no regression in the sector in which the borrower works, and that it is not affected by regression if any.

It should also be noted that credit pricing - the profit margin ratio - can be an indicator of a borrower’s credit ability. For example, accepting higher prices than the market may be an indication of failure to meet its demands with other FIs. Sound and efficient loan mechanisms and excellence in service provision are the best ways to attract customers when competition increases, rather than through leniency in the terms and conditions of the grant.

Third: Portfolio Average Maturity

Portfolio Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) is usually measured by measuring the average time remaining for loan entitlements in the Portfolio. WAM is a prerequisite for asset and liability management (ALM) . As we know, the nature of the domestic banking sector is based on “the longer the portfolio lasts, the higher the risk of any changes affecting the portfolio” such as: profit margin price, economic factors, potential for default.

Fourth: Macroeconomic Factors:

The prevailing and predictable economic environment plays an important role in borrowers’ performance, so credit and risk managers should periodically examine the economic factors affecting customers’ repayment capacity, including:

+ Higher margin prices, as higher prices negatively affect borrower performance.
+ Inflation rate, the increase in inflation affects the purchasing power of customers and thus negatively affects their ability to repay.
+ Unemployment Rate: The high unemployment rate means that more people are losing their jobs and therefore there are no sources of payment.
+ Business Default Rates: A high default in the business sector will inevitably lead to the loss of jobs and thus to a loss of income.

81

+ Real estate price rates (steep fall in real estate prices) lead to a depreciation of collateral 
and a change in the borrower’s repayment behavior (Moral Hazard).

B. Portfolio Management

Risk management usually analyzes the credit portfolio and submits it to senior management (Risk Committee/Board), but the importance is not in the preparation of these reports but in the decisions taken by management or the Board based on these reports.

In this context, it should be noted that (the independence of risk management and adequate support) are the key to the success of the management, giving confidence to Risk Manager and encouraging him to express his opinion transparently, in addition to helping invest in the human resources and systems necessary for the success of his management in carrying out its duties perfectly.

The time of reporting is also one of the most important factor in achieving the desired benefit from the reports. For example, if the portfolio is analyzed on a semi-annual basis, it is not necessary to wait six months for the report to be prepared if the sector experiences sudden developments such as the deterioration of the real estate market, a rise in interest rates, or new laws affecting the portfolio performance. In such cases, the portfolio must be analyzed immediately, the impact of new variables should be studied, and the appropriate stress scenarios should be implemented. The longer the portfolio is lived, the higher the risks to the portfolio, such as the interest rate, economic factors, and the possibility of default.

C. Consume Credit Scoring:

Consume Credit Scoring is one of the most important developments in FIs in the 1950s. It is based on an analysis of some data related to the borrower. Based on this analysis, the borrower is given a score that represents the extent of the client’s, possible, ability to make payment. The system has several benefits, including:
+ Efficiency of the credit process . 
+ The speed of decision-making in which credit decisions need to be made quickly and time-consuming given their large number. Therefore, FIs resort to adopting the outcome of the system in the automatic approval of finance in the event that it obtains the qualifying score.
+ Impartiality and avoidance of personal opinions, as the system analyzes data based on preset equations and weights.”
+ The ability to deal with a large number of factors affecting a credit study by a credit officer.
+ Savings in administrative expenses where credit is automated and human intervention is minimal.
+ The ability to price properly for all significant factors.

It should also be noted that the individual risk assessment system is usually used for two main purposes:
1. Customer acquisition:
It represents the most common usage in the past period and is based on analysis of customer request data such as: income, debt burden, age, nature of work...... etc.

83

2. Customer credit behavior analysis:

This method is based on an analysis of the customer’s obligation to pay installments on time (number of delays, default, number of days of delay.... etc.) This type of analysis is very important in determining the customer engagement strategy and the calculation of allocations where some FIs transfer the account to the collection management if the result of the evaluation indicates continued late payment and increased default opportunities.

There is no doubt that the lack of audited financial statements, as in some companies, and the lack of information sources and analyzes that reflect corporate performance, is a challenge to individual credit decisions. This is where the availability of customer data, customer performance data, systems and models for analyzing such data, and a closer look at customer behavior for timely and appropriate decision-making, are important.

## 4.4 Collection Regulations and Procedures:

Learning Objective

To be familiar with collection regulations and procedures.

### 4.4.1 Collection Regulations and Procedures:

When the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) differ, banks must determine the impact of risk mitigation (i.e., the method that reduces RWA).

The lending entity must also have clear rights on the guarantee and must be able to liquidate or legally acquire it in a timely manner. In the event of default or bankruptcy, all requirements set out in the transaction document must be met, even if the guarantor is not defaulting.

SAMA announced the issuance of “Debt Collection Regulations and Procedures for Individual Customers”. In this regard, SAMA emphasized that banks and financing companies operating in KSA must strictly apply the provisions of such Regulations within the framework of dealing with customers fairly and equitably in all stages of their relationship. Such Regulations relied upon the Finance Companies Control Law issued by virtue of Royal Decree #M/51 dated 13/08/1433 AH, and the Banking Control Law issued by virtue of Royal Decree #M/5 dated 22/02/1386 AH, which authorized SAMA to regulate the finance and banking sectors in line with SAMA’s keenness to keep FIs deal with customers fairly and equitably.SAMA stated that such Regulations shall apply to banks and financing companies under its supervision, so as to regulate methods of collection and communication with individual customers and guarantors thereof in so far as to allow finance entities to adopt clear and specific procedures that maintain the rights of all parties, develop standards required to ensure all employees are professionally providing customers with the correct information about their current situation regarding default and the legal procedures that may be taken by the finance entity.

Decisions issued by officials confirmed that banks, as requested by a retail consumer, must reschedule the debt when a compelling change in the circumstances of the retail consumer is proved, according to:

+ The debt shall be reschedule without granting any new loan
+ The debt shall be reschedule without charging extra fees
+ The debt shall be reschedule without charging Term Cost

They also added that such Regulations are minimum requirements against what should be provided by financing entities to take care of customers. Finance entities must continuously work on developing their own internal procedures, in line with the nature and size of their business and in accordance with the best local and international standards and practices.

According to “Debt Collection Regulations and Procedures for Individual Customers”, creditors must apply due diligence when communicating with a retail consumer before seeking recourse in competent judicial authorities, while observing that the authenticated means of communication that a creditor has the right to use when communicating with customers or their guarantors are limited to: E-mail, registered mail, national address, SMS messages and phone calls.

84

Debt Collection Procedures from Customer Accounts:

A bank must not: 
+ Deduct any amounts from a retail consumer’s accounts without a judicial order or ruling or without the retail consumer’s prior consent, or if provided otherwise in the finance contract.
+ Block accounts or balances of a retail customer, even if temporarily, and deny them access to funds available in their accounts without a judicial order or ruling.
+ Deduct more than one monthly installment for each loan within a single pay cycle, unless there is a judicial order or ruling or prior consent is obtained from the retail customer.
+ Deduct a monthly installment before the due date agreed upon or withhold an installment payment before the due date, as agreed in the finance contract.
+ Withhold or deduct end-of-service gratuities payable to retail customers, unless a judicial order or ruling was issued in this regard.
+ Creditors must set the date of deduction in accordance with the monthly payday, provided that such date is specified in the payment schedule or as may be agreed upon with the retail customer through any of the authenticated communication means.
+ Creditors must deduct the monthly installment on the agreed date of deduction. If it is proved that a creditor does not comply with the agreed date of deduction, they shall extend the finance period by a similar term to be added at the end of the period, without any term cost or additional fees, and notify the retail customer of the same through authenticated communication means.
+ A bank, as requested by a retail customer, must reschedule the debt when a compelling change in the circumstances of the retail customer is proved, without granting any new loan, charging extra fees or changing the term cost. A bank must carry out the rescheduling within a period not exceeding 30 days from the date the individual customer is provided with the necessary documents. This excludes asset-backed finance contracts.
+ A bank, as requested by a retail customer, must reschedule the debt in the case that voluntary changes in a retail consumer’s circumstances are proved, with the potentiality to change the term cost but without charging additional fees. Debt rescheduling must be carried out within a period not more than 30 days from the date the necessary documents are supplied by the individual customer. This excludes asset-backed finance contracts.Chapter

### 4.5.1 Procedures for Dealing with Defaulting Customers:

A creditor must be entitled to take legal actions against any defaulting customer at the competent judicial authorities, and such customer must be notified in the event of default for more than three consecutive months or five separate months throughout the finance period. The last attempt to contact such customer must be through their national address. It shall also:
+ Upon the issuance of a judicial order or ruling against a defaulting customer, a creditor must comply with the said order or ruling, unless both parties (creditor and retail customer) agree otherwise (for example without limitation, settlement of debt between both parties, debt rescheduling, etc.).
+ A creditor must take into consideration the circumstances of any defaulting individual customer that was issued an enforceable judicial ruling against them in favor of the creditor, when providing the necessary guarantees by making available the option of debt rescheduling, with the potentiality to change the term cost and without charging additional fees.
