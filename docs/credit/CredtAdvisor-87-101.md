Introduction:

This chapter addresses the concept of targets and how they are set, achieved, and pursued with the line manager. It also touches upon the Employee Performance Record in accordance with established procedures and determination of effective performance standards. It also provides an explanation of priorities to be adhered to by management and learn how to present information in a manner commensurate with the topic and target audience, in addition to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in FIs.

## 5.1 Objectives and its concept:

Learning Objective

To understand the nature of targets and how to identify them, whether at the level of individual or establishment in which he works.

### 5.1.1 Definition of Targets:

Targets are the outcomes intended from the program and plan. They are defined as outcomes or purposes pursued by the management. These outcomes must be designed and approved in advance in the planning stage. Targets are the change intended to be made at the level of individual’s performance, direction and behavior, and the objectives that a bank/company wants to achieve within a specific period, where the FI identifies the expected achievements by departments, jobs, sections, teams and individuals. Targets are a key element in administration’s work, as they serve in two directions:

Direction 1: They are a basis for drawing up policies and plans.

Direction 2: They are a standard for follow-up and performance assessment.

The Senior Management is responsible for setting and adjusting targets. Management-by-targets is a modern method for FI management. It is based on definition of each employee’s targets, then compare FI’s targets with employees’ targets, and then direct their attention to targets that have been set to ensure the best performance by everyone. Management-by-targets includes continuous control of activities and feedback review.

### 5.1.2 Setting of Targets:

Setting targets is a key basis that constitutes a cornerstone for management. Setting targets achieves personal aspiration, harnesses the individual’s energy and serves his tendencies, measures the progress achieved with regard to planned results by using regulatory criteria for achieving targets, and thus detecting failures, identifying the reasons for such failures, and working to correct them. It also guides human behavior, and measures his success and ability to employ his energies, because targets are like road signs that give the necessary impetus to reach them.

89

### 5.1.3 How to Set Targets:

In order to set targets, each department must discuss its targets in presence and participation of all employees, so that they have an effective role and remain aware of such targets. Then, the role of each employee must be discussed separately according to his/her job title. In this discussion, the employee’s targets and role in his department and in achieving its target are agreed. Moreover, the employee may communicate with his/her line manager to discuss or understand these targets. Targets approval must not be complicated, and must begin with key responsibilities or job duties agreed. After that, joint examination is made for each area, targets and agreed performance standards, to ensure that they are appropriate. An agreement may be reached on the implementation of any project that may be linked to specific responsibility or to larger and more general projects.

In addition, the employee must select a list of key responsibilities or functions that may relate to targets. Targets are quantified and time-bound, and always attain specific outcomes that can be measured along with its period of achievement, as targets may achieve a certain level of results, or improve performance in some ways. Targets can be translated financially, such as profits, income, costs reduced, or the budgets within which the employee will work, or in many other ways, such as: a specified number of operating units, responses received, or customers contacted within a given period.

### 5.1.4 Setting Targets at the level of individual and establishment:

There are two main types of targets namely:

- Individual targets
- Establishment targets

A. Individual or Personal Targets:

Personal targets relate to individuals’ work and improvement of performance (Performance Improvement Plans), or measuring their knowledge and skills, and their overall competence level (Continuing Professional Development (CDP) and Personal Development Planning (PDP)). Employees’ personal targets stem from the department’s plan and targets, which, in turn, stem from FI plan and targets. Therefore, it is natural that the targets of the department and employees be integrated within FI’s targets and plans, and then support and help achieve them.

- Personal Development Plan (PDP)

The Personal Development Plan is known as the process of developing a simple plan to develop specific skills or knowledge so that individuals can apply them professionally and consistently in their workplaces. However, a clarification of targets that are consistent with FI mission, public beliefs and values should precede any development plan. Personal Development Plan must address three key issues:

- What the employee is trying to achieve.
- Whether these achievements serve the employee’s professional growth.
- Whether they set specific procedures and steps (SMART).

90

Any plan should be targeted, its targets should follow SMART procedures and steps, and should be clear as to what this person wants to do or what he/she wants to be.

SMART term means:

| -          | -   |
| ---------- | --- |
| Specific   | S   |
| Measurable | M   |
| Achievable | A   |
| Realistic  | R   |
| Time Bound | T   |

B. Establishment Targets:

Work targets focus on results that individuals are expected to achieve, and how they contribute to achieving targets of the team, division and department, as well as preserving FI’s financing values, targets, and core mission.

There are different classifications of targets that FI should pursue. Below are some of common targets:

- Innovation and novation: FI must set new innovative standards for delivering its products and services in a better way, to achieve a positive customer experience.
- Productivity: Bank/FI must set targets for measuring efficiency of using its available resources.
- Financial and monetary resources: Bank/FI is interested in setting standards that help it utilize its financial and monetary resources in the best way.

91

## 5.2 Targets That Are Achievable in Agreement with the Line manager:

Learning Objective

To set targets that are achievable in agreement with the line manager.

### 5.2.1 Setting achievable targets:

The target must be achievable, implementable, and feasible so as to reflect Bank/FI management’s ambitions to improve the standards of Bank/FI’s products and services, and it must also be deliverable.

Achievable targets issued by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA) for the financial sector include:

The [Financial Sector Development Program](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/explore/programs/financial-sector-development-program) is one of the 13 operational programs launched by CEDA to realize the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030. The program seeks to develop the financial sector so that it becomes diversified and effective to support development of the national economy, stimulate savings, financing and investment, and increase efficiency of the financial sector to face and address challenges.

The program is underpinned by three main pillars:

1. Enabling FI to support private sector growth.
2. Developing an advanced capital market.
3. Promoting and enabling financial planning.

Targets must be set in agreement with the line manager, while ensuring:

- The line manager must review and discuss targets proposed by the employee to ensure that they are consistent with the management targets. He may also propose some additional targets and discuss them with the employee.
- The number of annual targets for each employee shall be set under the supervision of the line manager. In this sense, FI must rely on its employees to achieve the annual plans, and therefore the strategic plan. Each employee must have targets that conform to performance standards and indicators, and these targets must be measured annually.

### 5.2.2 Relationship between Targets and Motivation:

Work Incentives:

It is intended to stimulate individuals with the aim of satisfying certain needs. An incentive means to develop the desire to exert a higher level of efforts to achieve FI targets, provided that these efforts must lead to satisfying some individual needs. Incentives include two types, namely; Financial incentives, which are kind of monetary or economic incentives, such a type is among the oldest types of incentives, and is characterized by rapid influence and effectiveness. Moral incentives, which help people to satisfy their psychological and social needs.

Work Incentives and their Importance:

Incentivizing is one of the main factors that drives a person to respond and acts in a specific way to achieve a certain target, and to help FI accomplish a certain task. It is different from the motivations which are the desires, and needs that guide human behavior towards specific targets.

92

Motivation to work is self-induced energy that stimulates one’s desire to work, meaning that is an inner power that pushes the individual to pursue something and drives his actions and behavior towards that thing, while work incentives are an external matter exists at the society, or the environment surrounding a person, that attracts a person as a way to satisfy his needs.

Accordingly, the individual who needs money is driven by that feeling to seek work, so that his preference for a work is based on an increase in salary. Management at all levels must provide moral and financial incentives for members of its organization in order to lead them towards achieving organized targets and increasing production. The individual needs such incentives, because his inner motivations are not the only thing that drives him to development and success.

93
