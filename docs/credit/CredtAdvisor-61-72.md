## 3.1 Unusual and Suspicious Transactions and Procedures of Dealing therewith:

Learning Objective

1- To be familiar with unusual and suspicious transactions and procedures of dealing therewith.

### 3.1.1 Definition of Unusual and Suspicious Transactions:

Unusual and suspicious transactions are defined as transactions related to potential crimes or law violations punishable by law. Money laundering activities in financial institutions (FIs) represent an example of such transactions that involve obtaining, transferring or dealing with funds generated from suspicious, anonymous or illegal transactions through FIs so as to conceal or disguise the real source of funds, thus making the funds appear as if they had come from a legitimate source. Unusual or suspicious transactions also include funds that are directly generated from illegal activities prohibited by law such as drug and weapons trade, black market trading, theft of state funds, financial corruption, tax evasion, goods smuggling, banknote counterfeiting, and other illegal operations.

### 3.1.2 Indicators of Unusual and Suspicious Transactions:

Many indicators can be relied upon to identify unusual and suspicious transactions. According
to the MENAFATF, suspicious transactions can be identified by the following indicators:

### 3.2.1 KSA Legal Framework for AML/CTF:

Over the past decade, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undertaken a number of anti-money laundering initiatives and measures. It has been in the forefront amongst the active participating countries in combating money laundering and its related activities. KSA formed Anti-Money Laundering Permanent Committee, which is responsible for reviewing all issues related to anti-money laundering in the Kingdom and reporting, to His Majesty the King, the obstacles and difficulties faced by the authorities concerned in the implementation of the 40 Anti-Money Laundering Recommendations and making proposals and views to overcome them. KSA also joined the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and become a member recently in 2019.

The Kingdom derives its attitude towards anti-money laundering from its commitment to the Islamic Sharia teachings, domestic regulations and international recommendations equally. Legal frameworks are an essential tool and enabling factor in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, particularly as FATF pays a great attention to such matter in measuring efficiency of the so-called technical compliance. KSA legal frameworks for AML/CTF include:

Consequently, KSA has adopted a variety of initiatives involving legislative and other measures that are responsive to international developments in this concern. Below are some of KSA’s prominent initiatives in AML/CTF:

- Issuing the AML Law by virtue of Royal Decree # M/39 dated 25/06/1424 AH and

Implementing Regulations thereof, then the updated AML Law issued by virtue of Royal Decree #M/31 dated 11/05/1433 AH and Implementing Regulations thereof, followed by an update to this Law in 1439AH.

- Issuing the Combating Terrorism and Financing of Terrorism Law promulgated under Royal Decree #M/16 dated 24/02/1435 AH.
- Establishing the Saudi Arabian Financial Intelligence Unit (SAFIU).

- Establishing a mechanism to implement the international resolutions issued by the Security Council relating to AML/CTF.
- Circulating the United Nations financial assets freeze lists.
- Adopting FATF 40 Anti-Money Laundering Recommendations, in addition to the 9 recommendations regarding combating terrorism, to be implemented in accordance with KSA applicable laws and regulations.

## 3.5 Risk Management

Learning Objective

To be familiar with the concept of risk management, types and methods of management thereof.

### 3.5.1 Definition of Risk Management:

Risk management refers to a process carried out by an integrated management that aims to minimize possible risks posing a real threat to organizational functions. This entails business, investments and funds, where risks are identified or anticipated, then active methods and strategies are developed to deal with such risks. Such strategies involve several forms, for example, individual investment risks are mitigated by using government securities, as an alternative to corporate bonds with high returns, or by using future contracts and financial derivatives. Insurance is also a form of risk management. It is worth noting that the first definition of risk management dates back to 1950s, under the term “Risk Management and Business Projects”. In 1963, the term become widely known as “Risk Management”. In another context, Enterprise Risk Management is defined as modern approach or an area derived from the overall concept of risk management. It involves the process of evaluating, monitoring and following up everything related to business of organizations, whether in short or long term. Such approach categorizes risks in organizations as follows:

- Strategic Risks.
- Financial Risks, including: Interest rates, currencies, commodities and credit risk.
- Operational Risks, including: customer satisfaction, product quality problems, fraud and administrative corruption.

### 3.5.2 Risk Management Objectives

Risk management approach is used in numerous industries, including institutional work and organizations, public/government sector, banking sector, as well as individuals. Key objectives of risk management include:

1. Risk Prevention: Following all enabling procedures, and maintaining safety of both material and human elements in institutions against any possible losses.
2. Risk Control: Controlling and mitigating risks against any direct impact on workflow.
3. Safety Measures: Taking all necessary measures to keep work environment healthy and safe.
4. Awareness: Raising awareness on all potential risks, and ways to deal therewith (if any), as well as taking preventive measures to avoid such risks.
5. Regulations: Developing regulations and crisis forecasting mechanisms, to discover any potential risks proactively.

### 3.5.3 Key Risk Management Strategies

Key risk and threat prevention strategies include:

1. Risk Avoidance:

This strategy is to refrain from engaging in any activities or industries that pose a danger or threat, for example: Averting long-term securities investment to avoid interest rate risks.

1. Risk Acceptance:

This strategy is to accept and consider risks a fait accompli, and seek to mitigate their impact, to be ready for greater threats if any., such as obtaining health insurance, as an alternative plan to pay all treatment expenses in case of health issues that require paying a larger amount of insurance premium.

1. Risk Sharing:

This strategy is to share risks between an employee and company, which reduces costs of conflict, such as healthcare plans, where the company covers part of insurance premiums with the employee.

1. Risk Transferring:

This strategy is to transfer risks, such as health insurance, where a person pays premiums, and thus healthcare financial risks are transferred to insurance company.

1. Loss Prevention and Reduction:

This strategy is to minimize effects of risks, instead of prevention, i.e. to control risks and prevent their prevalence and spread.

As shown above, several strategies are used to enable both individuals and institutions to handle risks if any, minimize the resulting loss, and ensure business continuity, especially with the help of risk management experts and specialists who carry out all such strategies.

### 3.5.4 Types of Operational Risks:

First, almost all risks resulting from:

- Human mistakes.
- Occupational errors.
- Errors caused by technology, systems and procedures used, or deficiencies therein.
- Errors arising from internal incidents.
- Legal risks as a part of operational risks under Basel Convention on Banking Supervision.

Operational risks can result from internal or external factors, and can cause a direct or indirect loss for the bank.

### 3.5.5 Sources of Operational Risks:

1. Financial Fraud, Embezzlement and Crimes Resulting From Employee Moral Turpitude:

A study involved a five-year audit in some international banks, found that 60% of embezzlements were carried out by bank employees, 20% of which by managers, and 85% of bank losses caused by employees’ dishonesty.

1. Risks Caused by Employee Errors:

Risks that may be unintended, but result from inexperience or negligence in some cases. Banks encounter such risks due to lack of competencies, expertise, and institutions concerned with training and qualifications necessary for workforce.

1. Forgery Risks:

Involve forgery and misuse of checks and various documents. A statistical study estimates that forgery crimes constitute 10-18% of bank losses.

1. Banknote Counterfeiting:

An official US authority estimated the amount of counterfeit dollar banknotes outside USA

71

whose forgery cannot be detected by experts, to be around $1 billion. This indicates the size of such issue, having in mind the size of other counterfeit currencies, which may require less techniques than the dollar.

1. Theft and Burglary:

Some financial institutions may face theft and robbery due to weak procedures or failure to update control systems and procedures when trading cash.

1. Cybercrime Risks:

Such risks become more evident amid the extensive use of various banking transactions techs, including credit cards, point of sale cards, the internet, smart phones, and automated retail operations e.g. paying bills, as well as electronic exchange of information and ATMs.

1. Risks arising from errors, defects, malfunctions or insufficiency in technical hardware and software used in banks.

1. Legal Risks: Some legal risks can be anticipated, including:

- Risks arising from errors in contracts or other documentation.
- Risks arising from ineffectiveness or corruption of a country’s judicial ecosystem.
- Risks arising from delay in taking legal procedures in a timely manner.
- Risks arising from violating some laws or binding agreements, such as violating AML/CTF laws, or laws restricting currency exchange or foreign exchange in some countries or binding boycott laws.

1. Poor Planning:

This occurs due to missing information during procedures which reveals incorrect results, thus exposing the whole process to risks.

1. Uncontrollable Events (Force Majeure):

Such risks often occur due to external factors e.g. political or climatic issues, which affect performance of work. and thus endanger the financial institution’s position.
