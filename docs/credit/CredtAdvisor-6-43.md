## 1.1 Financing Products and Services:

Learning Objective

1.1 To be familiar with types of financing products and services provided by banks and financing companies to individual customers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

### 1.1.1 Financing Products and Services Rendered by Banks and Financing Companies to Individual Customers:

Financing services and products rendered by banks and financing companies in KSA vary according to requirements and needs of customers. In response to the increasing customers’ demand for banking services and products and in line with the technological evolution in the banking sector, banks competed to provide the best financial services to customers at competitive and reasonable prices, and further expanded in social services programs that significantly enhanced living standards and financial condition for many society groups. Customer’s objectives behind obtaining financing services differ according to his personal purposes, as he may seek an investment (long-term) or commercial business (financing an operational activity) or consumer financing or real estate financing.

This Chapter explores the main financial products and services delivered by banks and financing companies to individual customers within KSA, inter alia:

Credit Card:

A card that enables its holder to obtain in advance money, goods, services or other benefits from businesses accepting such card domestically and internationally, and repay the relevant indebtedness thereafter or in accordance with other arrangements. This definition does not include other types of cards issued such as debit cards, ATM cards and/or prepaid cards.

Credit cards include Visa, MasterCard, American Express...etc. Proceeding of purchases and cash withdrawals shall be within a certain credit limit previously agreed-upon between the customer and the card issuer, so that the customer shall pay the required amount later (upon issuance of the billing statement) either through a single payment or by fulfilling the minimum amount, where the customer may pay the minimum amount (5%) or any sum higher than the minimum amount out of the total amount due.

Learning Objective

To be familiar with regulations for consumer finance 

### 1.3.1 Regulations for Consumer Finance:

Financing granted to individuals dealing with FIs for nonbusiness purposes i.e. unconnected with the borrower’s commercial or professional activity, generally including personal financing, overdraft facilities, car financing, credit card payment, finance lease, and other related activities. Such financing includes loans for financing the purchase of goods and services for leisure, consumption or other needs of individuals as mentioned earlier, e.g. for the purchase of furniture or cover leave or education expenses. Consumer financing includes real estate restoration financing except mortgage loans.

SAMA issued the first update of Regulations for Consumer Finance, which included prominent changes, inter alia:

1. Transparency and Disclosure: 

Setting the minimum information to be indicated in consumer financing contracts including: 

Advertising Consumer Financing Products: Regulations of consumer financing that should be adhered to by the creditor include:
+ The creditor must indicate in all product advertisements its name, logo, any identifying representation and contact details. The advertisement must disclose, in a manner that is clear to the borrower, the name and Annual Percentage Rate of the advertised product and shall not include other rates such as the term cost.
+ The creditor must provide the borrower with a written disclosure statement that provides the information required be disclosed. A disclosure statement may be part of a financing contract or an application for a consumer financing or may be an annex to the foregoing documents.
+ Sharing Information between creditors and borrowers: the creditor should provide the borrower with full and accurate information required for the financing agreement. The borrower and the guarantor must accurately and completely produce any information necessary in this regard.
+ Non-interest based products: Documentation required for the purchase and sale of goods shall comply with requirements of the bank’s Shariah Board.
+ The creditor should provide customers with all documents related to the financing contracts, repayment schedules and borrower acknowledgement letters.
+ The creditor must register the purpose of all personal loans, and take measures to ensure such loans are used for the intended purposes.

2. Confidentiality or Privacy of Information: 
+ Personal information of the borrower, guarantor or other individuals required to conclude financing contracts should be kept confidential. Such information may not be processed unless for evaluating the financial position of such individuals and their capability to fulfill the agreed-upon finance.

18

+ Saudi Credit Bureau (SIMAH) operates a central database for the purpose of registering and recording the credit data of borrowers and guarantors. All banks must refer to the database before carrying out any commitment to the borrower or guarantor. Further, the personal data obtained may only be used for evaluating the financial position of the borrower and guarantor and their capability for payment.

3) Necessary Content of Financing Contracts or Guarantee Agreements:

+ Names of the parties to the financing contract, i.e. the creditor, borrower, and guarantor.
+ APR of charge and the term cost or profit calculated and specified at the time of concluding the financing contract. The actual borrowing cost and the comparability should be indicated. APR must include all mandatory charges or costs under a consumer financing as shown in the relevant advertising notices or materials.
+ The financing contract must stipulate the use of the declining balance method in distributing the term cost over the maturity period, which means that the term cost is allocated pro-rata to installments based on the remaining balance of the amount of financing at the beginning of the period for which an installment is due.
+ All fees, costs and administrative services charges to be recovered from the borrower by the creditor must not exceed the equivalent of (1%) of the amount of financing or SAR 5,000 (five thousand Saudi Riyals), whichever is lower, in addition to calculating VAT on the fee amount.
+ Statement of account in the form of repayment schedule if the financing contract involves capital amortization, in addition to outstanding payments, timeframes and repayment-related terms.
+ A statement indicating the periods and conditions for repaying the borrowing costs or profit and the recurring and non-recurring fees associated with it if there are special fees, commissions or profit to be paid without amortizing the capital.
+ Early payment or partial payment procedures and provisions and fees (if any) that must be paid by the borrowers to exercise such right. The creditor must accept any payment under a financing contract before its due date as partial payment if it is equivalent to one full installment or multiples thereof. The borrower may also pay the entire remaining amount of financing if he desires to do so (and enjoy early payment discounts). (Examples of early repayment in Appendix No. 1)
+ Terms, conditions and procedures to be applied and fees to be paid if the borrower exercises the right to drawdown any part of the amount of financing or has made partial, late or deferred payments. In the event of termination, the creditor may not charge or claim any term cost and or fees from the borrower unless the following conditions have been met:
1. Draw-down of any part of the amount of financing has occurred.
2. A credit card or other means of obtaining financing has been used to acquire goods or services for which financing is to be advanced under the financing contract.
+ In case of secured financing, the description of the asset that guarantees financing must be indicated, and borrowers must undertake to maintain the collateral assets so as to be available to the creditor in the event of default.
+ Right of Withdrawal: 

Except in non-interest based transactions, the borrower may, without producing any

19

justifications and within 10 calendar days from the date of execution of a financing contract, terminate the financing contract. Exercising the right of withdrawal obliges the borrower to return to the creditor any cash sums obtained under the financing contract and the borrower shall pay any due charges or profits against the period in which the amount of financing was withdrawn calculated based upon the agreedupon APR of charges. The creditor may not claim any further withdrawal-related charges and should immediately return to the borrower any payment made by him in advance under the financing agreement.

4) Annual Percentage Rate (APR), Finance Charge Rate (FCR), and Profit Rate (PR):

+ The APR and the Profit Rate:
Criteria have been set for calculating APR, which is an internationally recognized indicator to disclose the actual cost of financing, including all administrative costs and fees. APR of charge must reflect all mandatory expenses or unavoidable costs involved in any transaction as shown in advertisements or by other means. For non-interest based products, a similar methodology shall be utilized, i.e. for related and similar cash flows, withdrawals, payments and other fees for the purpose of calculating APR of charge. The total cost of financing for the borrower shall be determined including all mandatory costs except for fees payable by the borrower against violation of any of financing contract conditions. APR of charge shall be calculated based on the assumption that the financing contract will remain in effect for the agreed term and both the borrower and creditor will fulfill their obligations under the agreed terms and conditions.

+ Finance Charge Rate: 

Finance Charge Rate may be fixed or variable. The borrower must be notified in writing or via any other reliable means of any change in Finance Charge Rate. Such notification should include new APR, new total Finance Charge Rate set by the creditor, as well as the new schedule for debt amortization if so applied. 

+ Profit Rate: 
Profit Rate shall apply to all types of financing under all non-interest based financing contracts. Profit Rate means the rate used so as to generate profits from the invested funds, which also represent the Annual Percentage Rate.

5) Unfair Conditions:
The consumer-finance contract or guarantee agreement is considered unfair if it aims or may cause harm to the economic or other interests of the borrower, particularly if any of the following conditions are applied:
+ Changing any contractual expenses, compensation, or fees other than Financial Charge Rate or Profit Rate. 
+ Introducing conditions on the possibility of changing Financial Charge Rate or Profit Rate that prejudice the right of the borrower.
+ Applying methods that involve Financial Charge Rate or variable Profit Rates that have no connection to the net initial Financial Charge Rate or the proposed Pofit Rate at the time of concluding the financing contract.
+ Obliging the borrower to deal with the same creditor to refinance the remaining value or to finance the last installment of the financing contract for purchasing movable property or services.
+ Obliging the borrower – except for trade margin – as a condition for withdrawal, to leave as collateral all or part of the amounts borrowed or granted, or use all or part of such amounts to form a deposit or purchase securities or other financial instruments, unless the borrower gets the same currency price for the deposit, purchase or collateral such as the agreed APR of charge.
+ The borrower or guarantor shall not be required to sign a check guaranteeing payment of the amount due in whole or in part.

## 1.5 Standard Form for Contracts of Real Estate Finance (Murabaha and Ijara):

Learning Objective

To be familiar with the standard form for contracts of real estate finance (Murabaha and Ijara):

KSA financing companies adopts two main forms of real estate financing in compliance with provisions of Islamic Sharia, namely “Ijara” and “Murabaha”. The cost of current real estate finance contracts in the form of Ijara is variable, as their interest rate is associated with a reference index called “SIBOR”, which is usually for a period of one year or 12 months. The contract is re-evaluated at the end of each lease period according to SIBOR changes due to factors related to liquidity and overall economic status.

However, the cost of current real estate finance contracts in the form of Murabaha is fixed, as their interest rate is predetermined when the contract is concluded, and remains unchanged throughout the term of the contract.

SAMA issued an update of the standard forms of the real estate contract in Murabahah for individuals, and real estate contract in Ijarah for individuals. Real estate financiers must abide by these updated forms and may not conclude any contracts in violation of these forms or make any amendments thereto after issuing these forms on Jumada al-Thani 1441 AH.
