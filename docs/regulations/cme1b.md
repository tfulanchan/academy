Introduction to the Capital Market Authority

Introduction
Although the Saudi Arabian Capital Markets have informally operated from 1950, the Capital Market
Law (the Law) was introduced pursuant to Royal Decree M/30 dated 2/6/1424H (31/7/2003).1
The aim of the Law is to create a transparent, fair and regulated market. The associated implementing
regulations are continuously reviewed and, if applicable, updated to reflect developments in financial
markets. The Law formally established the Capital Market Authority (the Authority) as a fully
independent government organisation reporting directly to the Prime Minister. In addition, the Law
covers the following:
• regulation and development of the capital market
• regulation of the issuance of securities
• supervision of securities transactions
• supervision of Capital Market Institutions licensed by the Authority, and
• protection of investors and citizens from illegal practices.
The function of the Authority is to regulate and develop the Saudi Arabian Capital Market. This is done
via the issuance of rules and regulations implementing the provisions of the Law. The Authority’s basic
objectives are to:
• create an appropriate investment environment
• boost confidence
• reinforce transparency and disclosure standards in capital markets, and
• protect investors and dealers from illegal acts in the market.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Authority is entrusted with the following duties:
• regulate and develop the capital market and promote appropriate standards and techniques for all
sections and entities involved in securities trade operations
• protect investors and the public from unfair and unsound practices involving fraud, deceit, cheating,
manipulation, and inside information trading
• maintain fairness, efficiency, and transparency in transactions of securities
• develop appropriate measures to reduce risks pertaining to transactions of securities
• develop, regulate, and monitor the issuance of securities and under-trading transactions
• regulate and monitor the activities of entities working under the Authority, and
• regulate and monitor full disclosure of information related to securities and issuers.
The functions stipulated in the Law are being implemented through the issuance of rules, regulations,
instructions and necessary measures needed to implement the provisions of the Law.
Throughout this workbook, institutions that have obtained authorisation to operate in the Capital
Markets of the Kingdom are referred to as Capital Market Institutions.

1. Securities
Learning Objective
1.1.1 Know the types of securities specifically covered by the Capital Market Law (Chapter 1,
Article 2)
1.1.2 Know the types of instruments not covered by the Capital Market Law (Capital Market Law
Chapter 1, Article 3): instruments excluded from the definition of securities; securities listed or
traded outside of the Kingdom (Chapter 3, Article 26)
In the context of capital markets, the term security covers a range of financial instruments. Similar to
other international financial markets, the term is specifically defined in the Law to be any one of the
following:
a. convertible and tradeable shares of companies
b. tradeable debt instruments issued by companies, the government, public institutions or public
organisations
c. units by investment funds, or
d. any instruments representing profit participation rights and/or any rights in the distribution of
assets.
As new instruments come to market, the Board of the Authority (the Board) will assess whether they
fall under any of the existing categories, or whether an additional category may need to be added. The
main consideration in the assessment is to ensure the safety of the market or the protection of investors.
In addition, the Board may decide to exempt a specific instrument or rights from the definition if they
believe doing so does not impact either the safety of the market, or investor protection.
The following instruments are not considered to be securities under the Law:
• commercial bills, such as cheques
• bills of exchange
• order notes
• documentary credits
• money transfers
• instruments exclusively traded among banks, and
• insurance policies.
Any securities listed or traded in a regulated market outside of the Kingdom are not subject to the Law
even when the order for the purchase or sale is made from the Kingdom, unless this is otherwise agreed
between the Authority and foreign authorities.

2. Capital Market Authority
Learning Objective
1.2.1 Know the extent of the Authority’s responsibilities under the Capital Market Law and the
methods that it may employ to achieve those objectives (Capital Market Law Chapter 2,
Article 5)
1.2.2 Know the scope of the Authority’s powers (Capital Market Law Chapter 2 Article 6)
The Law contains the legal framework for the Capital Markets in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the
Kingdom) and applies to all capital markets activity. The issuing of rules, regulations, and instructions
to implement the Law is the responsibility of the Authority. The combined rules, regulations, and
instructions apply to all market participants in the Kingdom, and includes, among others, regulations
concerning the listing and trading of securities, licensing and supervision, and the operations of the
Exchange itself.
As part of their role, the Authority has the responsibility for the development and regulation of the
Exchange, the way in which the Exchange operates, and the entities trading securities on the Exchange.
The main objectives are to achieve orderly trading, and efficient and fair markets.
There are a number of risks associated with securities trading including, but not restricted to, failed
trades, failed settlements, insider trading and market manipulation. In order to reduce those risks, the
Authority has developed a number of procedures that apply to all market participants. In addition, the
Authority is responsible for the following:
1. Regulate the issuance of securities. This includes the monitoring of securities at the time they are
issued as well as ongoing monitoring as long as the securities are listed on the Exchange.
2. Regulation of market participants. All market participants in the capital markets of the Kingdom,
including brokers and the Exchange, are regulated, supervised, and monitored by the Authority.
3. Protection of investors against unfair, and high-risk practices by market participants as well as fraud
and cheating in any way including, for example, insider trading and market manipulation.
4. Ensure the market in securities transactions is fair, efficient and transparent.
5. Requirements in relation to the information that must be disclosed to the public. The Authority has
set standards for the disclosure of information related to:
a. securities
b. issuers of securities, and
c. dealings of major shareholders, majority investors and anyone who has, or may have, inside or
sensitive information.
6. Regulations related to pledging of securities as collateral.
In addition, the Authority has developed rules and regulations in relation to the trading of securities,
initial public offerings (IPOs) of securities, as well as extensive requirements in relation to the special
purposes entities (SPEs) including their use, registration, issuance of securities, funds transfers, legal
standing and regulation.

When the Authority issues or amends rules, regulations, or instructions (here after referred to as the
Regulations) they are usually first published in draft. Any new or amended Regulations clearly state the
starting date (effective date).
In the case of a suspected breach of regulations, the Authority may investigate and enforce the Law. The
members of the Authority and employees designated by the Board in this respect are empowered to:
• subpoena witnesses
• take evidence, and
• require the production of any books, papers, or other documents relevant to the subject of the
investigation which the Authority requires.
The Authority can request related documentation regardless of who holds it. Any information they
need to determine whether or not a provision of the Law and Regulations is, or will be, breached can be
requested and must be provided to the Authority promptly and without delay.
The Authority has far ranging powers, all of which are derived from the Law and Regulations, and
include, but are not limited to creating policies and plans, issuing and amending Regulations, approval
of securities offerings, and providing advice and recommendations to the government entities
responsible for market development and the protection of securities investments regarding issues
related to capital markets. It is also in the power of the Authority to suspend securities trading on the
Exchange for up to one business day, but suspension of more than one day must be approved by the
Minister of Finance. Other powers include:
1. approval, cancellation, suspension of listing of any Saudi security issued by any Saudi issuer on the
Exchange or any stock exchange outside the Kingdom
2. prohibit any security from listing, or suspend the issuance or trading of a security on the Exchange
3. set maximum or minimum brokerage commissions
4. approve fees and other commissions charged by the Exchange, the Depository Center, and the
Clearing Center
5. define standards for auditors as well as the content of annual and periodical statements, reports and
other documents
6. approve Regulations and policies of the Exchange, the Depository Center, and the Clearing Center
7. establish a clear mechanism for the reporting of a breach of any article or regulation related
to Capital Markets in Saudi Arabia and determine the rewards and protection to be granted to
whistleblowers
8. define the professional standards for brokerage firms and their agents, and
9. determine minimum capital and financial collateral for brokerage firms and the monitoring of their
financial status, ability and resilience through regular inspections and reviews to ensure compliance
with the regulations. Set out appropriate arrangements for the protection of deposited cash and
securities at brokerage firms.
The Authority works closely together with the Saudi Central Bank on the procedures that it intends to
undertake, and which may have an impact on the monetary situation.

3. The Exchange
Learning Objective
1.3.1 Know the role and objective of the Exchange (Capital Market Law Chapter 3)
1.3.2 Know the governance structure of the Exchange (Capital Market Law Chapter 3)
1.3.3 Know the scope of the Exchange’s powers (Capital Market Law Chapter 3, Article 23)
1.3.4 Know the functionality of the Committee for the Resolution of Securities Disputes (the
Committee) (Chapter 4, Article 30)
The Exchange is a stock exchange licensed to carry out trading related to securities in the Kingdom.
Any person who wants to undertake activities of securities must obtain a licence from the Authority.
Securities may be traded on a regulated exchange outside the Kingdom. Even though it is permitted
to trade on the foreign market by placing orders electronically or by phone, the securities are not
subject to Regulations in the Kingdom, unless otherwise agreed between the Authority and the foreign
authority.
One of the main objectives of the Exchange is to ensure a fair, efficient, and transparent market in
securities trading. This applies to the listing requirements, trading rules, technical methods, and
information. The Exchange is not permitted to distribute cash or dividends in kind unless this is
approved by the Board.
The Exchange specifies the conditions and requirements for membership of the Exchange including any
conditions and requirements. Members of the Exchange’s Board have to be approved by the Authority
prior to their election. The Exchange’s regulations include requirements of membership, code of
conduct, dispute handling, listing rules, and other related issues.
3.1 Dispute Resolution
Disputes related to public and private actions in the Capital Markets are governed by the Committee for
the Resolution of Securities Disputes (the Committee). The Committee is established by the Authority
and has the power to investigate and settle claims, to issue subpoenas, order the production of evidence
and documents, issue decisions, and impose sanctions. The Committee consists of one or more circuits
with each circuit consisting of three regular members and one substitute member, one of whom acts as
Head.
The Committee’s jurisdiction covers the Authority, the Exchange, the Depository Center and the
Clearing Center. They have the right to reward damages and request reversion to the original status, or
to issue any other decision that guarantees the rights of the person who brings the claim.

3.1.1 Committee Members
Members of the Committee are appointed by Royal Decree for a renewable term of three years.
Members must have expertise and qualifications in commercial and financial affairs, and securities. To
ensure independence, committee members and their families to the fourth degree must not have any
(in)direct financial or commercial interest with the parties who brings the complaint or the suit.
3.1.2 Timeline
Complaints must first be filed with the Authority, and unless otherwise permitted by the Authority, can
only be filed with the Committee once 90 days have passed. The Committee needs to start considering
a claim within 14 days of the date it was filed.
3.1.3 Appeals
Any party may appeal the Committee’s decision before the Committee. Appeals need to be raised thirty
days from the date the decision was notified. The Appeal Committee for Securities Disputes consists of
one or more circuits, each consisting of three regular members and one substitute member. Members of
the Appeal Committee are subject to the same requirements as Committee Members (see section 3.1.1
above).
The decisions of the Appeal Panel are final.
3.1.4 Enforcement
Final decisions are enforced through the government agency responsible for the enforcement of
judicial judgments.
3.1.5 Admissible Evidence
Evidence in securities cases shall be admissible in all forms including electronic or computer data,
telephone recordings, facsimile messages and electronic mail.

4. The Securities Depository Center
Learning Objective
1.4.1 Know the functionality of the Center (Capital Market Law Chapter 4, Article 27)
1.4.2 Know what action may be taken by the Center in the event of an error in, or any doubt over,
the information held by the Center (Capital Market Law Chapter 4, Article 27)
The Securities Depository Center is responsible for the registration of ownership of securities traded on
the Exchange.
The Depository Center maintains records of the following in relation to all securities traded on the
Exchange:
• ownership
• settlement
• clearing, and
• pledges or other claims.
The Depository Center is the only entity to register the ownership of securities traded in the Exchange
and their related rights. This record is conclusive evidence and proof of ownership. Ownership
registration is effective once the Depository Center has verified the authenticity of the ownership
documents. Any changes in ownership will be registered by the Depository Center promptly and
without delay. In the event there is doubt surrounding the ownership or in the event the Depository
Center is notified that registration will cause damages to third parties, the Depository Center has the
option to register ownership on a preliminary basis. The Depository Center will immediately following
the preliminary registration start the process to decide how the final registration for the security will be
affected.
Requests for the corrections of error in the information entered into the registry must be in writing,
addressed to the manager of the Depository Center, or the person specifically appointed to deal with
such requests. Once the validity of the request is confirmed, the person shown as the owner in the
register will be notified of the proposed changes for review and comment.
The Depository Center is liable for any monetary damage suffered by an investor that results an error
cause by proven negligence or misconduct of the Depository Center’s employees. Any compensation
due for the damage may be reduced or even eliminated if the claimant has contributed to causing the
error in registration or if the error could have been avoided.

2. Exclusions from Authorisation
Learning Objective
2.2.1 Understand the rules governing activities within groups and joint enterprises (Securities
Business Regulations Chapter 1, Article 8)
2.2.2 Understand the circumstances when securities activities might be excluded from authorisation
(Securities Business Regulations): exempt persons (Annex 1); activities carried out in the course
of non-securities business (Chapter 2, Article 9); sale of goods and supply of services (Chapter
2, Article 10); executors (Chapter 2, Article 11); sale of a company (Chapter 2, Article 12)
A security that is sold between two parties that are members of the same group or participants in a joint
enterprise (and the transaction is for the purpose of the joint enterprise) is not required to be licensed.
There are a number of other exemptions from authorisations.
2.1 Exempt Persons
A limited number of persons are exempt from having to obtain authorisation to undertake securities
activities. These are:
1. the Government of the Kingdom
2. Saudi Central Bank
3. the Exchange and any other stock exchange approved by the Authority
4. clearing house
5. Depository Center, and
6. any supranational authority recognised by the Authority.
An insolvency practitioner is exempt in relation to activities they undertake in this capacity. An
insurance company is exempt in relation to its insurance activities regulated by the Saudi Central Bank.
2.2 Activities Carried Out in the Course of Non-Securities
Business
A non-securities business that undertakes a securities activity as a necessary part of their business is
exempt from authorisation provided the profession or business does not otherwise constitute carrying
on securities business. For example, when a law firm or accountancy firm arranges or advises on a
security in the ordinary course of their business, the firm is exempt from authorisation. However, if the
same firm holds themselves out as providing securities activities, they will need to obtain a licence to
do so. The same applies to executors of a will who undertake securities activities in their capacity of an
executor.
In the same way, in a securities activity between a supplier and a customer that is necessary or ancillary
to the sale or supply of goods, there is no requirement for authorisation.

inviting or inducing a person to engage in securities activity.
Advertisements in relation to securities may only be made by Capital Market Institutions, and the
content must be approved by a Capital Market Institution. This does not apply to advertisements that
are not made or communicated to a person in the Kingdom if they are directed only at persons outside
the Kingdom.
Any advertisement related to securities activity that is exempt from authorisation is not subject to the
advertisement restrictions, for example, any advertisement aimed at exempt persons, or related to

carry out the securities business which it is authorised to carry out. The skills, experience, competence
and integrity of employees, officers or agents is an important factor in assessing whether it is fit and
proper. This includes adequate qualifications and professional experience, sound judgment, and
diligence. In addition, they should not have committed fraud or any other dishonest offence or
contravened any securities law.

1. Capital Market Institutions
Learning Objective
4.1.1 Know the principles that provide a general statement of the fundamental obligations of Capital
Market Institutions (Capital Market Institutions Part 2, Article 5)
4.1.2 Know the fiduciary duties that a Capital Market Institution owes to its customers (Capital
Market Institutions Part 5, Article 40 & Annex 5.4)
4.1.3 Know the restrictions placed on a Capital Market Institution’s dealings with its customers when
undertaking activities that involve risk (Capital Market Institutions Part 5, Article 42)
Similar to other jurisdictions, the Authority subscribes to the universal code of conduct to identify how
they expect Capital Market Institutions to behave. The following 11 principles apply:
1. Conduct business with integrity – be honest and have strong moral principles.
2. Conduct business with due skill, care and diligence.
3. Efficiency of management and control – take reasonable care to organise the business’ affairs
responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management policies and systems.
4. Financial prudence – maintain adequate financial resources in accordance with the rules issued by
the Authority.
5. Observe standards of proper market conduct.
6. Ensure adequate protection of clients’ assets.
7. Cooperate with regulators – including disclosing to the Authority any material event or change in
the Capital Market Institution’s business operations or organisation.
8. Communications with clients must be clear, fair and not misleading.
9. Treat customers fairly and pay due regard to their interests.
10. Resolve conflicts of interest by dealing with them fairly both between the institution and its clients
as well as between a client and another client.
11. Take reasonable care to ensure the advice given to clients, decisions made on their behalf in relation
to discretionary portfolio management, and any other services are suitable.
1.1 Fiduciary Duties
The financial industry is built on trust and it is, therefore, important that Capital Market Institutions
always act in good faith and in the interest of the customers. Any conflicts of interest must be managed
carefully (see also chapter 7, section 1 of this workbook).
A Capital Market Institution cannot use anything that belongs to the customer to make a profit. This is
not restricted to the customer’s money or other assets, but also applies to information they hold about
the customer. The only time the Capital Market Institution may use the customer’s assets or information
for their benefit is if the customer has specifically given approval for this and it is fully disclosed.
It is the responsibility of the Capital Market Institution to ensure they act with the care, skill and diligence
that can reasonably expected from anyone in the same position of trust and with their knowledge and
experience.

1.2 Risk
Due to their position, Capital Market Institutions should always make sure the customer understands
the nature and risk involved with any transaction, taking into consideration education and knowledge
level, field of work, and experience of the client. Capital Market Institutions must not deal, advise, or
manage for a customer in high-risk securities such as derivatives, non-retail investment funds, or illiquid
securities unless they can enable said client to understand the nature of the risks involved.

manager may delegate their responsibilities and duties to a third party, they remain responsible for any
losses incurred caused by fraud, negligence, misconduct or wilful default.
Public funds are established once the terms and conditions between the first potential unit holders and
the fund manager are signed. The terms and conditions contain information about the fund such as the
name of the fund and the fund manager, governing laws, main risks and how they are managed, fees,
valuation, pricing, and distribution. The terms and conditions govern the ongoing relationship between
the fund manager and the unitholders.

real estate investment trust (REIT) shall be deemed to have read and accepted the fund’s terms and
conditions upon purchasing any unit of an ETF from the Exchange.
Investment funds can be divided into categories based on the following criteria:
• client type who can subscribe to the investment fund
• changing capital of the investment fund, or
• the objective of the investment fund.

• Types of investment funds based on the changing capital of the fund:
• Open-Ended Investment Fund – an investment fund with changing capital, the units of which
would increase with the issuance of new units, and decrease with redemption by unitholders of
some or all of their units. Unitholders are entitled to redeem the value of their units at their net
asset value on dealing days set in the fund’s terms and conditions.
• Closed-Ended Investment Fund – any investment fund which is not an open-ended
investment fund.
• Types of investment funds based on the objective of the fund:
1. Specialised Public Fund:

1. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law
Learning Objective
5.1.1 Know which acts are considered to be money laundering offences (Anti-Money Laundering Law
and its Financing Law Article 2)
Within the AML Law the following acts are considered to be money laundering offences:
• converting or transferring funds that the persons know are proceeds of crime for the purpose of
disguising or concealing the illegitimate origin of the funds
• acquiring, possessing, transporting, using, receiving or transferring funds that the person knows are
the proceeds of crime, or from a criminal activity or an unlawful or illegitimate source
• concealing or disguising the true nature, source, movement, ownership, place or disposition of funds
that the persons know are derived from a criminal activity or an unlawful or illegitimate source, and
• complicity by means of agreement, assistance, incitement, counsel, advise, facilitation, collusion or
covering up any of the offences noted above.
The underlying criminal offence that generated the proceeds which are being laundered, is known as
the ‘predicate offence’. Under the AML Law, any act which could be punished under Shariah or statutory
law is a relevant predicate offence for money laundering.
2. Preventative Measures
Learning Objective
5.2.1 Know the preventive measures that should be adopted in relation to (Anti-Money Laundering
Law and its Financing Law): assessing money laundering risk (Article 5); anonymous, fictitious
or numbered accounts (Article 6); due diligence (Article 7 & 11); prominent public functions
(Article 8); correspondent relationships (Article 9)
The Anti-Money Laundering Law sets out a range of preventive measures which Capital Market
Institutions must implement in order to reduce the risk of being utilised for the purposes of money
laundering.
2.1 Risk Assessment
In line with international best practice, the AML Law, and its Implementing Regulations, require Capital
Market Institutions to adopt a ‘risk-based approach’ which means that the firm’s AML controls must be
tailored to reflect the money-laundering risk to which they are exposed.
Therefore, a Capital Market Institution should devote more time, effort and resources to activities and
customer relationships which pose a greater risk, and less to those with a lower risk profile.

The starting point for this approach is the risk assessment which Capital Market Institutions are required
to carry out under the AML Law.
Capital Market Institutions must identify, assess and document their money laundering risks, taking into
account a wide range of factors, including:
• their customers or risk factors relating to the beneficial owner or beneficiary
• the countries or geographic areas that the customer operates in, including the origination of
destination of transactions
• the products and services that they offer
• the types of transactions undertaken by clients, and
• delivery channels used to reach out to customers/engage with customers.
The purpose of the risk assessment process is to ensure that Capital Market Institutions have a
comprehensive understanding of the principal areas of money laundering risk to which it is exposed.
The level of risk faced by individual Capital Market Institutions varies from very low to very high. In
addition, the risk a Capital Market Institution is exposed to may vary between the various factors listed
above.
For example, Capital Market Institutions may primarily offer products and services which present a low
money laundering risk, but some of their customers may have business operations in countries with are
defined as having a high money laundering risk.
The risk assessment must be up to date, and new products, business practices and technology
enhancements must be assessed for AML risk before they are introduced.
The risk assessment must be provided to the supervisory authorities when requested.
When carrying out its risk assessment, Capital Market Institutions must also take into account variables
which may increase or decrease the money laundering risk, such as:
• the purpose of an account or relationship
• the size of deposits or transactions undertaken by a customer, and
• the frequency of transactions or duration of the relationship.
Opening and keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in obvious fictitious names or numbered
accounts is prohibited.
Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, Capital Market Institutions must develop and implement
internal policies, controls and procedures to mitigate the risk of money laundering that are appropriate
to manage the risks identified.
These internal policies, controls and procedures must be monitored and updated to ensure that they
remain appropriate and relevant.

2.2 Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
Having completed a risk assessment, Capital Market Institutions must put in place a series of measures
designed to manage the risk of them being used for the purposes of money laundering. One of the most
important controls is customer due diligence (CDD).
The CDD process is intended to ensure that Capital Market Institutions have sufficient knowledge of
the client to have confidence that their products and services will not be utilised by the client for the
purposes of money laundering, or other forms of financial crime. This process is also commonly known
as and may be described as know your customer (KYC).
It is vital that CDD policies and procedures reflect the results of the risk assessment completed. In
particular, Capital Market Institutions with high levels of risk in relation to money laundering need
to ensure that they implement extensive and robust CDD procedures to reflect the high level of
risk exposure. They would also need to apply the countermeasures prescribed by the Anti-Money
Laundering Permanent Committee on high-risk countries.
Capital Market Institutions are required to apply due diligence measures to their customers.
The Implementing Regulations specify the particular circumstances in which such measures must be
applied:
• before opening a new account or establishing a new relationship
• before carrying out a transaction for a customer with whom there is no established business
relationship, whether a single transaction or a series of apparently linked transactions
• before carrying out a wire transfer for a customer with whom there is no established relationship
• whenever there is a suspicion of money laundering, regardless of the amount involved, or
• whenever there are doubts either about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer
information or identification data.
It is important to note that CDD activities are undertaken when onboarding a new client, after which
they are regularly repeated during the relationship with the customers.
The Implementing Regulations require Capital Market Institutions to determine the extent of the CDD
measures based on the risks relating to the specific business or customer relationship. In this regard, it
is important to distinguish between the risk profile of the Capital Market Institution as a whole, and the
risk relating to a specific customer relationship. As noted above, the implementation of CDD measures
reflects the overall money laundering risk profile of the Capital Market Institution.
When determining the specific CDD measures which should be applied to a particular customer
relationship, Capital Market Institutions need to also assess the level of risk posed by that client.
For example, if a Capital Market Institution with a low overall risk profile seeks to enter into a relationship
with a higher risk client. It is important that the CDD measures which are applied reflect the higher risk
profile of the specific customer, rather than relying on the more limited measures which might be
appropriate in a lower risk context.
The CDD required will also vary depending on whether the customer is a Natural Person (ie, an
individual) or a Legal Person (such as a company, trust or foundation).

2.2.1 CDD Measures
The Implementing Regulations to the AML Law specify the following CDD measures as a minimum that
a Capital Market Institution must:
a. Identify the customer and verify the customer’s identity using reliable, independent source
documents, data or information:
• Full name registered in the official documents
Information relating
• Residential or national address
to individuals would
• Date and place of birth
include:
• Nationality
• Name and legal form of the entity
• Proof of its existence
Information relating • Names of directors, senior managers or trustees
to legal entities would • Address of the registered office and, if different, the principal
include: place of business
• The powers that regulate and bind the Legal Person or legal
arrangement
b. Depending on the risk posed by a specific customer, the financial institution or designated
non-financial business and profession shall determine whether any additional information must be
collected and verified.
c. Verify that any person acting on behalf of the customer is authorised by the customer to do so, and
must identify and verify that person as above.
d. For Legal Persons, identify the beneficial owner and take reasonable measures to verify their
identity.
Beneficial owners:
• any natural person who ultimately owns or controls 25% or more of the legal entity’s shares
• any person exercising control over the legal entity, or
• if there is doubt over the identity the beneficial owners, as a last resort, identify and verify
the person who holds the position of senior managing official.
For a customer who is a corporate or a legal partnership, a financial institution or designated
non-financial business or profession shall identify and take reasonable measures to verify the
identity of the endower, beholder, the beneficiaries or classes of beneficiaries, and any other
Natural Person exercising ultimate effective control over the legal arrangement.
e. Understand and obtain additional information on the purpose and intended nature of the business
relationship.
f. For Legal Persons or legal arrangement, the ownership and control structure of the customer
should be understood.

2.2.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
As described above, CDD measures that apply to customers must be tailored to the money laundering
risk profile of that customer. In the case of low risk clients, simplified measures, for example requiring
less detailed information from the client, can be applied.
However, in the case of higher risk clients, enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures are required to be
undertaken on any transactions or business relationships involving countries that are identified as high
risk.
2.3 Prominent Public Function
Capital Market Institutions must undertake EDD in relation to customers with prominent public
functions, or with senior management positions in international organisations. This is on the basis that,
whilst most individuals in such positions do not engage in any criminal behaviour, their public position
increases the risk that they might be involved in, or associated, with bribery or corruption including
misuse or embezzlement of state assets.
The requirement for EDD is intended to ensure that the Capital Market Institution has sufficient
information about the customer, so as to be confident that the transactions associated with them are
legitimate.
Capital Market Institutions are required to determine whether a customer, or beneficial owner in the
case of a legal entity, holds a prominent public function, either within the Kingdom or a foreign country,
or in an international organisation.
Such individuals are typically described as politically exposed persons (PEPs), and the Implementing
Regulations define them as follows:
• heads of state or of government, senior politicians, senior governments, judicial or military officials,
senior executives of state owned corporations and important party officials, or
• directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent function of any international
organisation.
In addition to the individuals performing these roles, the rules on PEPs extend to their family members
and close associates:
Family members of • Any individual who is related to a PEP by blood or marriage to the second
a PEP degree.
• Any person who has joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or who is
Close associates of in a close business relationship with a PEP.
a PEP • Any person who has beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal
arrangement set up for the de facto benefit of a PEP.

Whilst PEPs are recognised as higher risk clients, Capital Market Institutions are not prohibited from
doing business with them. However, the Implementing Regulations to the AML Law requires that where
there is the intention to enter into a business relationship with a PEP from a foreign country to, Capital
Market Institutions must:
• obtain senior management approval before establishing or continuing the relationship
• take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and the source of funds of the PEP, and
• conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.
The same obligations apply in respect of a PEP from the Kingdom, if the PEP is assessed as presenting a
higher risk of money laundering.
2.4 Anonymous, Fictitious or Numbered Accounts
As described above, CDD is one of the most important measures required to be implemented in order to
reduce the risk that Capital Market Institutions will be used for the purposes of financial crime, including
money laundering.
The Implementing Regulations stipulate that if a Capital Market Institution is unable to meet the
requirements relating to CDD they may not open an account, establish a business relationship or carry
out a transaction for a client.
Furthermore, anonymous or numbered accounts and accounts in obviously fictitious names are
prohibited.
2.5 Correspondent Relationships
Capital Market Institutions can enter into correspondent relationships with foreign banks. These are
relationships where a bank provides services to another bank (the respondent bank) such as, for wire
transfers or accepting deposits.
Correspondent relationships typically allow a bank in one country to facilitate cross-border transactions
for its clients, by means of a relationship with a correspondent bank in another country. Such
arrangements are common and a legitimate part of international banking transactions. However,
correspondent relationships can also expose a bank to increased risks relating to money laundering,
primarily when a bank carries out transactions on behalf of the clients of the respondent bank. The bank
carrying out the transaction has no direct relationship with the underlying client, and so must have
confidence that the respondent bank has undertaken sufficient due diligence to manage any money
laundering risk associated with the client relationship.
Before entering into a cross-border correspondent relationship, Capital Market Institutions must carry
out a range of measures to manage the money laundering risk associated with such a relationship. These
measures include assessing the correspondent firm’s AML controls and obtaining senior management
approval. Risk-mitigating measures include:
• obtaining sufficient information about the respondent bank to fully understand the nature of their
business
• determining the reputation of the respondent bank and the quality of their supervision
46

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Rules
47

• determining if the respondent bank has been subject to any money laundering investigations or
regulatory action
• assessing the respondent bank’s AML controls
• clearly understanding each party’s responsibilities regarding AML, and
• satisfactory assessment that the respondent bank does not allow the use of shell banks.
A shell bank is a bank that is legally registered in a particular country, but have no physical presence
there. Such banks are associated with very high money laundering risks, and Capital Market Institutions
are prohibited from entering into a correspondent relationship with a shell bank, or with a respondent
bank that permits the use of shell banks.
3. Detecting Money Laundering
Learning Objective
5.3.1 Know how to fulfil ongoing monitoring requirements (Anti-Money Laundering Law Articles 13
& 14)
5.3.2 Know what to do if suspicious activity is detected (Anti-Money Laundering Law Articles 15 &
16)
As set out earlier in this chapter, before entering into a new customer relationship, Capital Market
Institutions must carry out a series of measures to manage the money laundering risk associated with
the potential customer. This process begins with an assessment of the risk associated with the particular
customer, which then allows them to determine the appropriate level of due diligence measures –
simplified, standard or enhanced.
Capital Market Institutions must then complete the relevant due diligence and, in the case of higher risk
clients, may be required to seek senior management approval.
Due diligence must be undertaken at the start of a relationship with a customer as well as on an ongoing
basis. Specific requirements in relation to ongoing monitoring of client activity are that a Capital Market
Institution must:
• monitor and scrutinise transactions, documents and data on an ongoing basis to ensure that they
are consistent with the reporting entity’s knowledge of the customer, the customer’s commercial
activities and risk profile, and where necessary the customer’s source of funds
• review complex and unusually large transactions, and any unusual pattern of transactions that have
no clear economic or legal objective
• where the risks of money laundering are higher, the financial institution (FI) or designated non-
financial business and profession (DNFBP) shall perform EDD, and
• keep records for ten years and make them available to competent authorities on request.

In order to meet these requirements, Capital Market Institutions must implement a range of measures
depending on the nature of the customer relationship and the transactions being carried out. For
example, for high volume, but low-risk value transactions, the monitoring may primarily be carried out
by automated systems which are designed to ‘flag’ any suspicious or unusual transactions, or patterns
of transactions. Larger or more complex transactions, on the other hand, may need to be reviewed by
specialist staff with particular knowledge of money laundering methodologies and risks.
The requirement for ongoing monitoring of client activity reinforces the need for appropriate due
diligence measures to be applied at the outset of the relationship. In particular, it is vital that Capital
Market Institutions have a full understanding of the purpose and intended nature of the business
relationship. In the absence of proper understanding of the types of transaction that a client is expected
to carry out, it will be very difficult to determine whether transactions on a client’s account are consistent
with expectations. Poor or incomplete due diligence at the outset of a relationship is, therefore, likely to
lead to inadequate monitoring of the account.
3.1 Suspicious Activity Reporting
Capital Market Institutions have a crucial role in the fight against money laundering, not only in relation
to the preventative measures that they apply, but also in their response to identification, prevention
and reporting of suspicious activity to the authorities.
It is rare for a Capital Market Institution to have clear proof that a particular transaction or customer
account is being used for the purposes of money laundering. Criminals seeking to launder the proceeds
of crime will typically disguise their money laundering activity, making it difficult to identify funds
as the proceeds of crime. However, there may be various circumstances in which they suspect that
a transaction or client account may be being used to facilitate money laundering. Capital Market
Institutions are required to report any activity which gives rise to suspicion of money laundering, even
where the firm has no specific proof of criminal activity.
Any suspect, or situation where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the proceeds
of crime or are related to money laundering, must be reported to the General Directorate of Financial
Intelligence. The report should include all information relating to the transaction and relevant parties,
and the Capital Market Institution must respond promptly and fully to any requests for further
information.

4. Failure to Comply
Learning Objective
5.4.1 Know the sanctions for violating or failing to comply with any provision of the Anti-Money
Laundering Law, its Implementing Regulation and relevant decisions or circulars (Anti-Money

The Kingdom’s Law allows for a wide range of penalties to be applied to any Legal or Natural Person that
commits a money laundering offence. A fine of up to SAR 5 million per violation of the provisions of the
AML Law by a Capital Market Institution can be imposed as well as other measures, including:
• issue a written warning
• issue an order to comply with a specific action
• issue an order to report on measures to address the violation
• monetary fine of up to SAR 5 million
• restrict powers of directors, board members, executive of supervisory management members and
controlling owners, including appointing one or more temporary controllers
• banning individuals from employment within the relevant industry sector
• dismissing or replacing directors and/or senior managers
• suspending or restricting a Capital Market Institution’s business activities, or

5. Combating Terrorism Crimes and its Financing
Law
Learning Objective
5.5.1 Know the preventative measures that must be in place in relation to Combating Terrorism
Crimes and its Financing Law: assessing risk (Article 63) and due diligence (Articles 64 & 66)
The Combating Terrorism Crimes and its Financing Law (the CFT law) imposes specific obligations
on Capital Market Institutions in relation to the identification and prevention of terrorist financing. It
requires Capital Market Institutions to implement a range of preventative measures to help mitigate the
risk of the Capital Market Institution being used for such purposes.
50

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Rules
51

5.1 Assessing Risk
Similar to AML, the starting point for a Capital Market Institution firm is to ensure it has a comprehensive
understanding of the CFT risks to which it is exposed. A Capital Market Institution needs to be able to
identify, assess, understand and document the financing of terrorism risks, taking into account a wide
range of risk factors.
The particular factors listed are the same as for the AML risk assessment, namely:
• Capital Market Institution customers
• countries or geographic areas
• products and services
• transactions, and
• delivery channels.
5.2 Due Diligence
In addition to the requirement for risk assessment, Capital Market Institutions are obliged to apply
due diligence measures tailored to the risk profile of customers and business relationships. This
includes applying EDD measures in situations where the CFT risks are high, and specifically requires the
application of EDD in relation to business relationships and transactions with persons from high risk
countries.
6. Record-Keeping Requirements
Learning Objective
5.6.1 Know the record-keeping requirements in relation to: Anti-Money Laundering Law (Article 12);
Combating Terrorism Crimes and its Financing Law (Article 65)
In addition to meeting all of the requirements set out in the AML and CFT Laws firms must ensure they
maintain all required records relating to their AML and CFT controls. These records not only provide
evidence that they are meeting its various legal and regulatory obligations, but may also provide crucial
information in the context of an investigation into a particular customer relationship or transaction.
Capital Market Institutions need to keep all records and documents relating to both domestic and
international clients for a period of ten years from the date of concluding the transaction or closure
of the account. Due diligence documentation must be maintained for at least ten years after the end
of the business relationship. In specific cases, the authorities are empowered to require records to be
maintained for as long as required for the purpose of criminal investigation or prosecution.
Records must be stored in such a manner that will allow the reconstruction of transactions and can be
readily made available to the authorities when requested.
Record-keeping requirements are similar for domestic and foreign financial transactions.

7. Penalties for Non-Compliance
Learning Objective
5.7.1 Know the sanctions for violating or failing to comply with any provision of the Combating
Terrorism Crimes and its Financing Law its Implementing Regulations and/or relevant
decisions or circulars (Combating Terrorism Crimes and its Financing Law Article 83)
Capital Market Institutions who breach any of the provisions of the CFT Law or its Implementing
Regulations, may be subject to a fine of up to SAR 5 million per violation imposed by the Authority, and
may also apply other measures, including:
• Banning individuals from employment within the relevant industry sector.
• Dismissing directors and/or senior managers.
• Suspending or restricting business activities.
• Suspending, restricting or revoking the licence to trade.

To ensure the efficient, honest, and transparent working of the market, there are a number of
prohibitions in place. The prohibitions concern untrue statements, manipulation and insider trading,
and proxy solicitations and conducting securities business activities without a licence. Each of these
have penalties associated with them to deter market participants from committing any of the violations.
Each of these prohibitions and how they impact honest and transparent working of the market is
outlined in the remainder of this section.
1. Untrue Statements
Learning Objective
6.1.1 Understand the regulations concerning the prohibition of untrue statements (Market Conduct
Regulations Part 4, Article 7)
6.1.2 Know the regulations governing rumours (Market Conduct Regulations Part 4, Article 8)
6.1.3 Understand the circumstances under which a person may be liable for damages in respect of
making an untrue statement (Market Conduct Regulations Part 4, Article 10)
Untrue statements cover both an untruth about a material fact, and omitting to share information in
order to influence the price or value of a security, or to entice someone else to trade in the security. In
other words, it is false or inaccurate, a misrepresentation or an omission made by the person themselves
or by someone else on their behalf.
A person should not make any untrue statements, either verbal or in writing, with the purpose to
influence the price or value of a security, or to attempt someone else to trade in the security.
In this context, a material fact is any information relating to a security which would have had an impact
on the price they would have been willing to buy or sell the security at if they would have known the
truth.
Anyone making an untrue statement can be held liable for damages if the claimant can prove that they
were not aware that the statement was untrue and that they would not have bought or sold the security
at the price they did, if they would have known there is a high possibility that the statement is not true
about the core incident. In addition, it must be proven that the person who made the statement knew it
was untrue. In any case the claim must be in relation to the purchase or sale of a security.
1.1 Rumours
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a rumour as an ‘unverified story or report of uncertain or doubtful
truth’. In the current global, interconnected world rumours spread rapidly and it is often difficult, if not
impossible, to identify the source. It is not easy to assess whether a rumour has an impact will have an
effect on a financial market and how large the effect is likely to be. Investors may or may not decide to
act on a rumour, resulting in market movements which have no basis in fact.

Not every person who passes on a rumour does this deliberately. In some cases, a person is not aware
of the information is false when they pass it to someone else. Others start or pass rumours knowing the
information is false. They do this deliberately with the intention of affecting the market.
Example
An unprincipled investor holding shares in a particular company could deliberately spread a rumour
that the company is going to be purchased at a premium price by a larger competitor. They do this in
the hope that other investors will believe it and decide to purchase shares in anticipation of a rise in
value. If enough investors do so, it may result in a sharp price rise, at which point the originator of the
rumour would sell their shares at a profit.
1.2 Responsibility for Making Statements
Anyone omitting a material fact can be held liable for damages if the claim is related to the purchase or
sale of a security or securities. The claimant will have to prove that:
• they were not aware the statement was untrue, and
• they would not have purchased or sold the security, or securities, if they were aware of the untrue
statement, or they would have done so at a different price.
2. Manipulation and Insider Trading
Learning Objective
6.2.1 Know activities and practices that are considered to be manipulative (Capital Market Law
Chapter 8, Article 49)
6.2.2 Know what types of person are regarded as insiders (Capital Market Law Chapter 8, Article 50)
6.2.3 Know when information should be regarded as inside information (Capital Market Law Chapter
8, Article 50)
6.2.4 Be able to analyse examples to identify instances of insider trading (Capital Market Law
Chapter 8)
Market manipulation relates to intentional acts with the purpose to create a false or misleading
impression of the market, prices, or value of any security. Market manipulation and inducing others to
do so are prohibited under the Law.
The following are types of manipulation:
1. Any act or practice with the intention to create a false or misleading impression of the price and
number of transactions executed in the security.
58

Prohibitions
59

2. To affect the price of one or more securities traded on the Exchange by executing a series of sale or
purchase transactions creating actual or apparent active trading or causing an increase or decrease
in the prices of such securities.
3. To undertake any series of transactions with the purpose of pegging or stabilising of the price of a
security through any series of transactions.
An insider is a person who obtains inside information through family, or business or contractual
relationships. Insiders may not directly or indirectly trade in the security to which the inside information
is related, or to disclose the inside information to another person with the expectation that the other
person will trade in the security.
Insider information is information obtained by an insider, which is not available to the general public
and has not yet been disclosed. Also, any normal person would realise that knowledge of the nature
and content of this information, its release and availability would have a material impact on the price
or value of the security. The insider knows that such information is not generally available and that, if it
were available, it would have a material effect on the price or value of that security.
3. General Sanctions and Penalties for Violations
Learning Objective
6.3.1 Know the sanctions that can be issued by the Committee for the Resolution of Securities
Disputes for violation of any provisions of the law, regulations, and rules issued by the
Authority (Capital Market Law Chapter 10, Article 59 and Article 62)
6.3.2 Know the penalties and reasonable defences relating to misstating or omitting material facts
(Capital Market Law Part 5, Chapter 10, Article 56)
6.3.3 Know the penalties for undertaking, or purporting to undertake, brokerage activities without a
licence (Capital Market Law Part 5, Chapter 10, Article 60)
3.1 Sanctions for Violations of the Law
In case the Authority believes a person is violating, has violated, or is about to, violate any of the laws
and regulations, they can bring legal action before the Committee to issue appropriate sanction, and
these possible sanctions include:
1. a warning
2. forcing the person to stop the act subject to the legal action
3. forcing the person to take the necessary steps to be taken to avert the violation, or take necessary
corrective steps
4. forcing the person to pay damages resulting from a violation, or pay a penalty of to up to three times
any realised gains or avoided losses as a result of the violation
5. suspending the trading in the security
6. barring the violating person from acting as a broker, portfolio manager or investment adviser for
such period of time as is necessary for the safety of the market and the protection of investors

7. seizing and executing property
8. a travel ban, or
9. barring from working with entities subject to the Authority’s supervision.
In addition, the Authority may impose a fine of not more than SAR 25 million per violation.
Instead of bringing legal action as outlined above, the Authority may warn the person concerned, force
the person to take the necessary corrective steps, and/or impose a penalty of a maximum of SAR 5
million per violation.
The Authority is responsible for regulating the compensation procedures. They may establish
compensation funds funded by the illegal gains collected in the Authority’s accounts. The distribution
of compensation will be approved by a decision of the Committee.
In addition to the person committing the violation, the Authority may also issue a reprimand to any
other person granted authorisation involved in the violation. This reprimand may be accompanied by:
• restrictions on their licensed activities
• restriction on their functions or operations
• suspension of their activities for a maximum of 12 months, or
• revocation of their licence.
Before restricting or revoking their licence, the Authority has to give sufficient notice and give them the
opportunity to a hearing where it will be assessed if they have deliberately given any materially false or
misleading statement, or have deliberately broken any laws or court judgements either in the Kingdom
or abroad. If the Authority finds it necessary for the safety of the makers and for investor protection, they
may suspend the brokerage licence pending the final result of the hearing.
In urgent cases, the licence may be suspended for a period of maximum 60 days without a hearing or
notice.
3.2 Misstating or Omitting Material Facts
A material statement or omission is any statement or omission that would have affected the purchase
price if the investor would have been aware of the truth.
The damages that can be awarded is the difference between the price paid or received (with a maximum
of the price at which they were offered to the public), and the price on the Exchange prior to the claim
was made. If the defendant can prove that any part of the decline in value is not related to the omission
or the incorrect statement the damages will be reduced accordingly.
3.3 Undertaking Brokerage Without a Licence
Undertaking brokerage activities without a licence is a violation of the law.
Any agreement or contract of securities undertaken by an unlicensed broker shall be void. The violating
broker cannot raise a complaint against the other party in the transaction, and the other party has the
right to cancel the contract and either get their money or their securities back.

to obtain information about the customer’s financial situation, investment experience and investment
objectives before entering into any transaction. This information must be updated at least every three

An inducement is something that persuades a person to do something. For example, providing
excessive gifts such as all-expenses paid trips, or expensive jewellery in return for another person to do
business with you.
Capital Market Institutions may not induce a client to engage in any transaction by offering or giving
gifts or inducements; or accepting gifts or inducements if doing so would conflict to a material extent
with any duty which it owes to a client.
Offering to make good some or all of the losses made by a customer is also an inducement.
Special commission arrangements are arrangements where a Capital Market Institution receives trade
execution services as well as other goods or services in return for a share of the commission paid on
transactions directed through the intermediary. These arrangements are permitted as long as:
1. the transaction execution is the best execution
2. the goods or services are justifiably for the benefit of the Capital Market Institution’s clients
3. the special commissions are disclosed in the terms of business, and
4. the amount of any fees or commission paid is reasonable.

is suitable for the customer. When assessing suitability, they need to consider all information available
including the customer’s knowledge, financial standing, length of time they have been operating in the
relevant markets, size and nature of the transaction, and the customer’s investment objective.
If the customer still wants to enter into the transaction, despite it being unsuitable for them as
per the suitability report, a Capital Market Institution may execute the transaction after obtaining
an acknowledgment from the client provided that the suitability report records this and the
acknowledgment of the client is retained.
4.2 Customer Borrowing
A Capital Market Institution shall not lend money or extend credit to a customer to enter into a securities
transaction unless it is specifically agreed with the customer and the customer has specifically given
consent in writing and the Capital Market Institution has made and recorded an assessment of financial
standing based on information disclosed by the client and is satisfied the amount and arrangements are
suitable for the customer.
4.3 Margin Requirements
Margin transactions may only be undertaken for a customer if this is specifically agreed in the terms
of business with the client. The terms of business need to specifically state when the client may be
required to provide margin, the form in which it can be provided, and any recourse for the Capital
Market Institution if the customer does not pay. The Capital Market Institution is entitled to close out the
position in any event after a period of five days from such failure.
Secured or unsecured loans or credit may be given to a client for a period of more than five days for the
purpose of covering margins payments provided the appropriate credit assessments are completed and
the customer’s approval obtained. In relation to effecting a margin transaction on shares of companies

Part 5, Chapter 1, Article 30)
8.1.3 Know the requirements governing employees’ personal dealings (Capital Market Institutions
Regulations Part 5, Chapter 6, Article 50)
1.1 Conflicts of Interest
It is the responsibility of a Capital Market Institution to take all necessary steps to avoid conflicts of
interest between their own interest and the interests of their clients. Any actual or potential conflicts
of interest need to be disclosed to the customer in writing, except when this is considered to be inside
information.
When a conflict of interest cannot be disclosed because it relates to inside information, the Capital
Market Institution must make sure they take reasonable steps to ensure fair treatment for the customer.
If the Capital Market Institution has disclosed the conflict of interest and the customer has decided they
want to continue with the transaction, they must let the Capital Market Institution know in writing. In
this case, the Capital Market Institution will not be responsible for compensation of any losses to the
customer resulting from the conflict of interest.
Best execution rules continue to apply.
1.2 Chinese Walls Arrangements
A Chinese wall arrangement is a written arrangement intended to make sure that confidential or inside
information obtained by the Capital Market Institution in the course of their business is only known by
those employees who need to have access to it for their work. Chinese walls must be in place in firms
that provide corporate finance services as well as other types of dealing, advising or managing services.
As long as effective Chinese wall arrangements are in place, the Capital Market Institution and their staff
will not be in violation of insider trading when they transact in a security for which they have no access
to the inside information held by another part of the firm. However, the Capital Market Institution will
need to be able to prove that they have established appropriate Chinese wall arrangements for the size
and nature of their business and that the arrangements are implemented and maintained. In addition,
it must be proven that none of the individuals involved in the dealing or advising activity, or received
advice regarding the dealing transactions or take advice from an insider.

5.6)
2.1 Contract Notes
Unless the Capital Market Institution acts as a manager for the client and the client has confirmed he
does not need to be sent contract notes, the Capital Market Institution needs to send a written contract
note to the client following each purchase or sale of securities.
Contract notes need to specify the name and contact details of the Capital Market Institution, the name
and contact details of the client, trade date and time, an identification of the securities, and other
transaction details such as the price, settlement date, commission and other fees and taxes, currency (if

Market Institutions’ Regulations Part 5, Chapter 6, Article 51)
3.1 Client Records
An Capital Market Institution must keep and maintain proper records of each transaction it effects.
Such records must be current at all times and be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with these
Regulations. In addition, the Capital Market Institution must keep and maintain proper records of client
accounts. Client records must, at all times, accurately record the assets and liabilities of each client and
of all clients collectively. In addition, client records must contain all information necessary to enable
the preparation of a statement of each client’s assets and liabilities, and details of transactions effected
for the client; and identify all client money and client assets that the Capital Market Institution, or its
custodian, are responsible for.
The records of the Capital Market Institution must contain:

including the results of any analysis undertaken for at least ten years from the date the business
relationship has ended or a transaction was carried out for a customer who is not in an established
business relationship.

In specific cases, the Public Prosecution may oblige the firm to extend the record-keeping period for as

All telephone communications from clients or potential clients relating to securities business must be
recorded, and the Capital Market Institution must disclose this to the client.
All records of telephone conversations related to securities business must be retained for a period of

recordings will need to be retained until the dispute is fully resolved or the enquiry completed.
4. Management Arrangements
Learning Objective
8.4.1 Know the management arrangements that should be in place in relation to (Capital Market
Institutions’ Regulations): the division of responsibilities (Part 6, Chapter 2, Article 53); systems
and controls (Part 6, Chapter 2, Article 54); general provisions (Part 6, Chapter 3, Article 55);
review by the governing body (Part 6, Chapter 3, Article 56); compliance (Part 6, Chapter 3,
Article 57); the Compliance Committee (Part 6, Chapter 3, Article 58); outsourcing (Part 6,
Chapter 3, Article 59); audit (Part 6, Chapter 3, Article 60, 61, 62); complaints (Part 6, Chapter
3, Article 63); employees (Part 6, Chapter 3, Article 65); business continuity (Part 6, Chapter 3,
Article 66)
4.1 Division of Responsibilities
Segregation of duties or division of responsibilities refers to the concept of needing more than one
person to complete a task. This is an internal control measure to prevent errors and frauds, but also to
ensure it provides clarity about who is responsible for which areas and that the business is adequately
monitored and overseen by senior managers, the board of directors and the governing bodies.
Capital Market Institutions need to maintain a clear and appropriate division of the principal
responsibilities among its directors and senior management. The governing body is responsible for the
division of responsibilities and oversight within the organisation.
4.2 Systems and Controls
A Capital Market Institution must establish and maintain systems and controls that are appropriate to its
business. The systems and controls need to consider the nature, scale and complexity of the business,
the diversity of operations, the volume and value of transactions and the level of risk associated with
each of the areas in the organisation.
78

Systems and Controls

The governing body is ultimately responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations, and having
appropriate systems and controls in place will assist with this.
4.2.1 Review by a Governing Body
The review is the responsibility of the governing body who needs to maintain a regular review to assign
its responsibilities, systems and supervisory functions at the Capital Market Institution, the review has
to be undertaken once every three years. The actions must be monitored until they are completed. The
reports following a review must be maintained for ten years from the date on which the review was
completed.
4.2.2 Compliance
A Capital Market Institution must appoint a senior officer as their compliance officer. It remains the
ultimate responsibility of the governing body to ensure that the firm complies with all relevant laws and
Regulations.
The compliance department must be appropriately resourced, and be able to freely access all the
records of the firm. The compliance officer will compose the compliance manual containing appropriate
policies and procedures, and implement it throughout the organisation. The compliance manual will
be periodically reviewed and amended if required. The compliance department is further responsible
for the establishment of, and ensuring compliance with, a code of conduct, the preparation of reports
and notifications to be filed with the Authority, and the procedures to be followed for reporting any
compliance matters to the governing body.
It is the right of the Authority to review the appropriateness of a Capital Market Institution’s compliance
arrangements at any time.
Depending on the nature, scale and complexity of its business, a Capital Market Institution may establish
a Compliance Committee to monitor its securities business and its compliance programme. The
members of a Compliance Committee should include, but are not limited to, the CEO, the compliance
officer and the MLRO, and the minutes of the meetings must be kept. Compliance meeting minutes
must be retained for ten years.
4.2.3 Outsourcing
Outsourcing refers to the hiring of a third party to provide services or job functions on behalf of the
Capital Market Institution. Specific compliance or other functions may be outsourced provided the
Capital Market Institution has assessed the third party is suitable to undertake the work. An outsourcing
contract must clearly state the extent and limits of the outsourced function, and suitable arrangement
must be in place for the Capital Market Institution to supervise the third party. In the event there are
concerns about the third party’s performance, appropriate remedial action must be taken.
When selecting a third party to outsource to, the Capital Market Institution must undertake sufficient
due diligence. The authorised firm remains responsible for their regulatory obligations.

4.2.4 Audit
Depending on the nature, scale and complexity of its business, a Capital Market Institution may appoint
an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee must meet at least twice a year, and their meetings must
be minuted. Audit Committee meeting minutes must be retained for ten years. Part of the task of
monitoring the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems and controls may be delegated to an
internal audit function, provided this is in line with the scale, nature, and complexity of the business.
To ensure their independence, the internal audit function must have clear responsibilities and reporting
lines to the Audit Committee or appropriate senior manager, be adequately resourced and staffed by
competent individuals, be independent of the day-to-day activities of the Capital Market Institution and
have appropriate access to a Capital Market Institution’s records. Meetings of the internal audit function
must be minuted and the minutes must be retained for a period of ten years.
It is the responsibility of a Capital Market Institution’s internal auditors to review books, accounts and
other records related to securities business at least once every three years. All accounts, records, terms
of business and other agreements must be made available to the internal auditor.
4.2.5 Complaint Resolution
A Capital Market Institution must have written procedures in place to ensure client complaints are
handled in a timely and proper manner. Complaints and any actions need to be clearly documented.
In the event a complaint arises from the actions of a third party employed or recommended by the
Capital Market Institution, they will need to intervene on behalf of their client to resolve the issue.
All employees must be aware of the complaint’s procedures.
4.2.6 Employees
To ensure the workforce of a Capital Market Institution consists of employees who are appropriately
qualified for their jobs and are honest, adequate procedures for the recruitment, training, supervision
and discipline of employees must be in place. Ongoing training must be made available to all employees.
Any disciplinary action must be documented, including the name of the employee, the conduct that
gave rise to the action, as well as steps taken to discipline the employee.
Employees must be trained at least annually on any updates to the Capital Market Law and the related
rules and regulations that are relevant to the business of the Capital Market Institution.
Appropriate records including recruitment procedure, experience, and qualifications must be retained
for a period of ten years from the date on which the Capital Market Institution recruited the employee.

4.2.7 Business Continuity
A Capital Market Institution should have in place appropriate arrangements to ensure they can continue
to operate in the event of an unforeseen interruption of activities. These arrangements need to be
commensurate to the nature, scale and complexity of their business.
All business continuity arrangements must be documented, regularly tested, and updated if required.
Documentation must be retained for a period of ten years after they are amended or no longer relevant.
